# Portamento/Glide Implementation Research
**Research Date**: 2025-01-07  
**Target**: Real-time synthesizer implementation patterns

## Executive Summary

Industry-standard portamento implementations favor **exponential curves** (matching analog RC circuit behavior) with **0.1-10 second time ranges**. Gate-dependent (legato) mode is most musical for performance. Polyphonic portamento requires sophisticated voice allocation to avoid chaotic pitch movements. Your proposed 0-1.5s range is conservative but reasonable for musical applications.

## Concrete Performance Data

### Timing Specifications
- **Common Range**: 0.1ms - 10 seconds across synthesizer implementations
- **Musical Sweet Spot**: 50ms - 2.5 seconds for most musical contexts
- **Ultra-fast glides**: 1-50ms for percussive effects
- **Slow atmospheric**: 2-10+ seconds for ambient textures
- **Logic Pro X MIDI Script**: Uses 0-500ms with 1-50ms resolution steps

### Performance Characteristics
- **SuperCollider Lag**: 60dB convergence time (0.01% accuracy)
- **Sample Rate Dependency**: Control-rate smoothing typically sufficient (64-256 samples/block)
- **CPU Impact**: Minimal for exponential curves (single multiply per sample)
- **Memory**: Requires only previous pitch value storage per voice

## Critical Gotchas

### Polyphonic Voice Chaos
- **Round-robin allocation**: Causes unpredictable glide paths between chord changes
- **Voice stealing**: Can create jarring pitch jumps when voices are reassigned  
- **Solution**: Requires "intelligent" voice allocation matching musical intervals

### Pitch vs Frequency Domain Issues  
- **Linear frequency glides**: Sound unmusical due to uneven interval perception
- **Critical Rule**: Always work in pitch/note space, then convert to frequency
- **Analog Reality**: RC circuits naturally provide exponential behavior in voltage domain

### Digital Implementation Traps
- **Lag filter limitations**: SuperCollider's VarLag has control-rate restrictions
- **Never-quite-reaching target**: First-order filters asymptotically approach but never reach exact pitch
- **Quantization noise**: Very slow glides can expose digital stepping artifacts

## Battle-Tested Patterns

### Exponential Smoothing (Most Common)
```
// SuperCollider pattern
freq = targetFreq.lag(glideTime)

// DSP equivalent: y[n] = y[n-1] + (target - y[n-1]) * alpha
// where alpha = 1 - exp(-1 / (glideTime * sampleRate))
```

### Linear Pitch Interpolation
```
// Logic Pro X MIDI approach
pitchBendSteps = glideTime / resolution
bendIncrement = (targetNote - currentNote) / pitchBendSteps
```

### Voice Allocation Strategy
```
// Intelligent polyphonic portamento
- Match new notes to closest existing voices by pitch distance
- Limit maximum glide distance to prevent extreme slides
- Provide "retrigger" option to disable glide on large intervals
```

## Trade-off Analysis

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| **Exponential** | Analog-authentic, fast initial movement | Never quite reaches target | Classic synth emulation |
| **Linear in Pitch** | Mathematically precise, reaches target | Can sound "digital" | Modern software synths |
| **Time-constant** | Predictable timing regardless of interval | Large intervals sound rushed | Rhythmic applications |
| **Rate-constant** | Musical interval proportionality | Unpredictable timing | Expressive performance |

### Mode Comparisons
- **Always-on**: Simple implementation, can create unwanted slides
- **Gate-dependent (Legato)**: Most musical, matches performance technique
- **Polyphonic**: Complex but necessary for chord work, requires careful voice management

## Schema/Parameter Conventions

### Standard Parameter Set
```
portamento: {
  time: 0.0-10.0,        // seconds (exponential scaling common)
  mode: [off, legato, always],
  curve: [linear, exponential, custom],
  polyphonic: boolean,
  retrigger_threshold: 12  // semitones - disable glide above this interval
}
```

### Implementation Scaling
- **UI Control**: Often exponential taper (0.001-10s feels linear to user)
- **Internal Storage**: Linear seconds for consistent behavior
- **MIDI Mapping**: CC typically 0-127 â†’ exponentially mapped time range

## Red Flags

### Avoid These Patterns
- **Linear frequency interpolation**: Sounds unmusical for wide intervals
- **Sample-accurate timing**: Control-rate smoothing (64-256 samples) sufficient
- **Complex curves without benefit**: Exponential RC behavior is tried-and-true
- **Polyphonic without voice intelligence**: Creates chaotic pitch movements

### Performance Killers
- **Per-sample calculations**: Pre-calculate filter coefficients
- **Expensive curve functions**: Stick to simple exponential decay
- **Unnecessary precision**: Control-rate smoothing adequate for most applications

### Silent Failure Modes
- **Zero-time parameters**: Can break modulation systems (set minimum ~0.001s)
- **Infinite sustain**: Ensure exponential filters eventually reach target
- **Voice allocation edge cases**: Always have fallback voice assignment strategy

## Key Principles

1. **Exponential curves win**: Match analog behavior and sound more musical
2. **Work in pitch domain**: Convert to frequency only for oscillator control  
3. **Gate-dependent default**: Most musical for performance contexts
4. **Polyphonic needs intelligence**: Simple round-robin allocation sounds chaotic
5. **0.1-2.5s covers 90% of use cases**: Your 0-1.5s range is musically appropriate
6. **Control-rate sufficient**: Don't over-engineer with audio-rate smoothing

## Implementation Recommendations

For your real-time system:
- **Time Range**: 0.001-2.5 seconds (exponential taper for UI)
- **Default Curve**: Exponential (RC circuit emulation) 
- **Default Mode**: Gate-dependent (legato)
- **Polyphonic Strategy**: Intelligent voice allocation or mono-only initially
- **Update Rate**: Control-rate (every 64-256 samples) adequate
- **Interaction with LFOs**: Apply portamento to pitch CV before modulation
