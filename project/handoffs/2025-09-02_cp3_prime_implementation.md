# Session Handoff: CP3 Prime Implementation Started

**Created**: 2025-09-02 20:30  
**From Session**: Chronus Nexus  
**To**: Next Chronus Instance  
**Context Window**: 95% - Critical

## 🎯 Critical Context

CP3 router fix complete, well-behaved producer implemented, but audio still has silent buffer issue. Root cause identified: patch state not reliably applied before swap. Started implementing direct priming via patch_queue per Senior Dev guidance.

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Router Fix for Multi-Commit

- Implemented generic `spawn_worker()` with `is_standby` parameter
- Router capability now follows role, not slot number  
- Fixed hardcoded `is_standby = (slot_id == 1)` issue
- Result: Multiple patch commits work (3 cycles tested)

### 2. Well-Behaved Producer Scheduling

- Replaced aggressive catch-up with rate-limited production (max 2 buffers/cycle)
- Added ring occupancy check to prevent overfilling
- Fixed stats spam bug (was printing every loop when n%500==0)
- Result: No more death spiral, `occ=2, drop=0` consistently

### 3. Started Prime Implementation

- Added `self.prime_ready = [mp.Value('i', 0), mp.Value('i', 0)]` to supervisor
- Documented complete implementation plan in `/docs/cp3_prime_implementation_plan.md`
- Next: Add prime handler to worker, update commit handler, fix swap gate

## 🚧 Current Working State

### What IS Working:

- ✅ Router multi-commit - Can build/commit/swap patches repeatedly
- ✅ Well-behaved producer - Maintains ring occupancy without flooding
- ✅ Worker respawn - Correct `is_standby` role assignment

### What is PARTIALLY Working:

- ⏳ Audio generation - Produces buffers but many are silent
- ⏳ Parameter application - Works via OSC but unreliable timing

### What is NOT Working:

- ❌ Clean audio - 44% none-reads, silent buffers after swap
- ❌ Direct priming - Not yet implemented (just started)

### Known Issues:

- 🐛 Silent buffers after swap - Modules lose state/parameters
- 🐛 Brief audio then silence pattern - Gates likely resetting

## 🚨 Next Immediate Steps

1. **Complete Prime Implementation**
   - Add prime operation handler to worker (lines ~145-200)
   - Pass `prime_ready[slot_id]` to worker on spawn
   - Standardize to 4-tuple format: `(op_type, module_id, param, value)`

2. **Update Commit Handler**
   - Replace OSC priming with direct patch_queue prime
   - Build prime ops list from module types
   - Send prime command with warmup count

3. **Fix Audio Callback Swap Gate**
   - Check `self.prime_ready[standby_idx].value == 1`
   - Don't early return - always write output
   - Reset prime_ready on respawn/abort

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

**Created:**

- `/docs/cp3_deadline_fix_report.md` - Initial deadline analysis
- `/docs/cp3_anchored_scheduling_report.md` - Anchored scheduling implementation
- `/docs/cp3_final_status_report.md` - Death spiral analysis
- `/docs/cp3_session_summary.md` - Session achievements
- `/docs/cp3_prime_implementation_plan.md` - Complete prime implementation guide

**Modified:**

- `src/music_chronus/supervisor_v3_router.py` - Major changes:
  - Lines 117-135: Well-behaved producer init
  - Lines 229-277: Rate-limited production
  - Lines 344-385: Generic spawn_worker
  - Lines 341: Added prime_ready array
  - Lines 610-615: Respawn with correct is_standby

## 💡 Key Insights/Learnings

- Aggressive catch-up scheduling catastrophic - unbounded loops flood ring
- Static role assignment breaks worker swapping - need dynamic is_standby
- Current priming via OSC unreliable - commands arrive after audio starts
- Silent buffers indicate state issue not timing - ring healthy but audio empty

## 🔧 Technical Notes

Senior Dev corrections to implement:
- Prime readiness must be supervisor-owned mp.Value array
- Use 4-tuple format for all prime ops: `(op_type, module_id, param, value)`
- Gate ops: `('gate', 'env1', None, 1)` - handler ignores param field
- Never early return from audio_callback - always write output
- Reset prime_ready[slot_id].value = 0 on respawn and abort

## 📊 Progress Metrics

- Phase 3 Progress: 85%
- Tests Passing: 15/15 unit tests
- Context Window at Handoff: 95%
