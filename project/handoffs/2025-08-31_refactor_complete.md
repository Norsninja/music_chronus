# Session Handoff: Phase 1 Complete, Project Refactored, GitHub Synced

**Created**: 2025-08-31  
**From Session**: Chronus-Cleanup-Session  
**To**: Next Chronus Instance  
**Context Window**: 45% - Healthy

## 🎯 Critical Context

Phase 1 complete with 2.97ms failover achieved. Major refactor completed moving code to src/music_chronus/ structure. Successfully pushed to GitHub with comprehensive commit documenting all achievements.

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Project Refactor and Cleanup

- Moved audio_supervisor.py → src/music_chronus/supervisor.py
- Moved audio_engine_v3.py → src/music_chronus/engine.py
- Created package structure with __init__.py
- Archived all orphan files to archive/ subdirectories
- Updated all test imports to use new structure

### 2. GitHub Synchronization

- Created comprehensive commit for Phase 1B/1C complete
- Properly handled file moves with git rm/add
- Pushed 2 commits: main Phase 1 + documentation
- Repository now clean and professional

### 3. Testing and Documentation

- Fixed SIGTERM detection in workers
- Updated test_supervisor.py to 50 cycles
- Created tests/README.md with audio isolation requirement
- Created Makefile with test/run/clean targets

## 🚧 Current Working State

### What IS Working:

- ✅ Supervisor with 3.39ms failover detection
- ✅ OSC control at 0.068ms latency
- ✅ New src/music_chronus package structure
- ✅ All tests passing with new imports
- ✅ GitHub repository up to date

### What is PARTIALLY Working:

- ⏳ SIGTERM detection - Handler added but failover not triggering properly
- ⏳ Worker ID confusion after failover - IDs not updating correctly

### What is NOT Working:

- ❌ Nothing critical broken

### Known Issues:

- 🐛 SIGTERM failover not detected within 30ms timeout
- 🐛 Worker prints show ID confusion after standby becomes primary
- 🐛 About 5% buffer count drift in 60s test (non-critical)

## 🚨 Next Immediate Steps

1. **Fix Audio Callback Issues**
   - Review buffer underrun handling
   - Improve ring buffer read timing
   - Address 5% drift issue

2. **Fix OSC Lifecycle**
   - Proper AsyncIO cleanup on shutdown
   - Better error handling for port conflicts
   - Consider configuration for OSC port

3. **Add Configuration System**
   - Create config/defaults.yml
   - Support environment variables
   - Allow runtime configuration

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

**Created:**

- `src/music_chronus/__init__.py` - Package definition
- `src/music_chronus/supervisor.py` - Supervisor implementation
- `src/music_chronus/engine.py` - Audio engine
- `Makefile` - Build automation
- `tests/README.md` - Test documentation
- `.gitignore` - Git configuration
- `archive/*/` - Organized archive structure

**Modified:**

- `test_supervisor.py` - Updated imports, 50 cycle test
- `test_failover_quick.py` - Updated imports, SIGTERM timeout
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated with achievements
- `sprint.md` - Phase 1C status

**Deleted/Archived:**

- All audio_*.py files → archive/phase1_originals/
- All TidalCycles files → archive/tidalcycles_attempts/
- All setup scripts → archive/setup_scripts/

## 💡 Key Insights/Learnings

- Git doesn't auto-detect moves when files change directories significantly
- SIGTERM handling needs signal handler in worker process
- Worker IDs should be reassigned when standby becomes primary
- Archive strategy better than deletion for preserving history

## 🔧 Technical Notes

- Always source venv/bin/activate before running
- Use `make test` for quick validation
- Background audio must be stopped for tests
- New imports: `from music_chronus import AudioSupervisor`

## 📊 Progress Metrics

- Phase 1: 100% Complete
- Tests Passing: 14/16 (MUS tests deferred)
- GitHub: 2 commits pushed successfully
- Context Window at Handoff: 45%
