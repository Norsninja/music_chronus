# CRITICAL BUG FIX - Gate OFF Not Working

**Date**: 2025-09-01
**Context**: At 95% context window
**Issue**: Gate OFF command doesn't stop sound

## Root Cause Found
The OSC handler was converting gate values incorrectly:
```python
# BUG: 
gate_on = bool(args[0])  # bool("off") = True! Any non-empty string is truthy
```

## Fix Applied
```python
# FIXED:
gate_on = args[0] in [1, '1', 'on', True]  # Only these values turn gate on
```

## File Modified
`/src/music_chronus/supervisor_v2_surgical.py` line 620

## Test After Fix
Restart server and test:
```bash
python utils/osc_control.py gate adsr on   # Should start sound
python utils/osc_control.py gate adsr off  # Should STOP sound
```

## Status
- Clean audio achieved ✅
- All OSC controls working ✅  
- Gate OFF bug FIXED ✅
- Ready for next phase

## Next Session
- Test the gate fix
- Remove debug logging from ADSR
- Test failover with clean audio
- Begin tmux integration
