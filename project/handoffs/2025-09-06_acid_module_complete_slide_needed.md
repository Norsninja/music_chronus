# Session Handoff: Acid Module Complete, Slide Implementation Needed

**Created**: 2025-09-06  
**From Session**: Chronus Nexus  
**To**: Next Chronus Instance  
**Context Window**: 85% - Near Limit

## üéØ Critical Context

Successfully debugged and implemented TB-303 acid filter module with MoogLP, Disto, and full modulation. Engine routing issue fixed by storing acid output once and using explicit ordering. Module works but lacks slide/portamento which is essential for authentic 303 sound.

## ‚úÖ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Fixed Acid Module Signal Routing

- Diagnosed "one blip then silence" issue as graph connectivity problem
- Replaced Interp with explicit linear mix for wet/dry
- Fixed PyoObject arithmetic errors (Disto parameters, ADSR values)
- Resolved engine routing by storing acid output once instead of multiple get_output() calls

### 2. Implemented Full Acid Functionality

- Pre-filter Disto for 303 bite (drive mapped 0.5-1.0)
- MoogLP with envelope modulation (Clip 80-5000Hz)
- Resonance scaling proxy for HPF-in-feedback (0.2 + 0.8 * min(1, cutoff/400))
- Accent system affecting cutoff, resonance, envelope, amplitude
- Explicit linear mix for wet/dry blend

## üöß Current Working State

### What IS Working:

- ‚úÖ Acid filter module - Full DSP chain functional
- ‚úÖ 4-voice polyphony - All voices working with effects
- ‚úÖ OSC control - Complete schema for acid parameters
- ‚úÖ Engine routing - Voice2 replaced by acid output correctly
- ‚úÖ Parameter smoothing - Sig/SigTo for all modulatable params

### What is PARTIALLY Working:

- ‚è≥ Authentic 303 sound - Works but missing high-frequency squelch and slide
- ‚è≥ Frequency range - Currently biased toward low frequencies, needs higher cutoff ranges

### What is NOT Working:

- ‚ùå Slide/Portamento - Not implemented, essential for 303 authenticity
- ‚ùå Oscillator waveform - Using Sine instead of Saw/Square like real 303

### Known Issues:

- üêõ Sound too low-frequency focused - Need higher cutoff base (1000-3000Hz not 200-500Hz)
- üêõ No glide between notes - Missing characteristic 303 slide

## üö® Next Immediate Steps

1. **Implement Slide/Portamento in Voice**
   - Add Port or SigTo with glide time to frequency parameter
   - Enable per-note slide control via OSC

2. **Adjust Frequency Ranges**
   - Increase base cutoff range to 800-3000Hz
   - Test with higher pitched sequences (C3-C4)

3. **Change Oscillator Waveform**
   - Replace Sine with Saw or Phasor in Voice
   - Add square wave option for authentic 303

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

**Created:**

- `pyo_modules/acid.py` - Complete acid filter implementation
- `examples/test_acid_authentic.py` - Aggressive acid testing
- `examples/test_acid_high_freq.py` - High frequency testing
- `project/docs/2025-09-06_acid_module_signal_issue.md` - Debug documentation

**Modified:**

- `engine_pyo.py` - Fixed routing with explicit ordering
- `pyo_modules/__init__.py` - Added AcidFilter import

## üí° Key Insights/Learnings

- PyoObject arithmetic requires careful handling - can't mix Python operations
- Signal graph connectivity crucial - calling get_output() multiple times can break flow
- Dictionary iteration order matters for audio routing
- MoogLP works fine, issue was in how we connected signals
- Authentic 303 needs higher frequencies and slide to sound right

## üîß Technical Notes

- Disto parameters must be PyoObjects or numbers, not mixed
- ADSR time parameters require numeric values, not PyoObjects
- Use explicit linear mix: `input * (1-mix) + wet * mix` instead of Interp
- Store audio outputs once during routing setup to maintain graph connectivity

## üìä Progress Metrics

- Acid Module Implementation: 100%
- Slide/Portamento: 0%
- Authentic 303 Sound: 70%
- Context Window at Handoff: 85%
