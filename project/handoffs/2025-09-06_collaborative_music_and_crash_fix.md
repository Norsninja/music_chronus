# Session Handoff: Crash Fix and Collaborative Music Understanding

**Created**: 2025-09-06 16:35  
**From Session**: Chronus Nexus  
**To**: Next Chronus Instance  
**Context Window**: 90% - Critical

## 🎯 Critical Context

Fixed engine crash caused by rapid parameter updates (>100/sec overwhelms pyo DSP). Learned project's true purpose: AI creates music autonomously via OSC commands during conversation, NOT by writing Python scripts.

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Identified and Fixed Engine Crash

- Root cause: Rapid filter sweeps (16 updates in 1.6s) breaking pyo signal graph
- NOT threading issue as initially suspected - demos use time.sleep()
- Solution: Rate-limit parameter updates to 10-20Hz max
- Fixed acid_journey_demo.py with safer update rates

### 2. Understood Project Core Purpose

- This is conversational music creation - AI sends OSC commands directly
- Human and AI collaborate in real-time, music emerges from dialogue
- AI should be autonomous musical partner, not code writer
- Updated CLAUDE.md with clear examples and purpose statement

### 3. Learned PolySequencer API

- Correct method: `add_track(name, voice_id, pattern, **kwargs)`
- NOT set_track_pattern (doesn't exist)
- Tracks stored in dictionary, not list
- Created SEQUENCER_API.md documentation via research agent

## 🚧 Current Working State

### What IS Working:

- ✅ Engine stable with rate-limited updates - No crashes in testing
- ✅ PolySequencer running D&B beat at 175 BPM continuously
- ✅ Monitoring system - engine_status.txt and engine_log.txt
- ✅ 4-voice polyphony with effects

### What is PARTIALLY Working:

- ⏳ Collaborative music session - Started but needs API research
- ⏳ Pattern modification - Can create but not easily stop/modify

### What is NOT Working:

- ❌ Pattern saving/loading - Not researched yet
- ❌ Sequencer stop control - Background task management unclear

### Known Issues:

- 🐛 Background bash task (94bba5) still running D&B beat
- 🐛 Need better sequencer lifecycle management

## 🚨 Next Immediate Steps

1. **Research Sequencer Control**
   - How to stop running sequencer cleanly
   - How to modify patterns in real-time
   - Pattern save/load functionality

2. **Develop Collaborative Workflow**
   - Create reusable patterns for quick deployment
   - Build musical vocabulary for AI
   - Test real-time pattern evolution

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

**Created:**

- `examples/acid_journey_demo_safe.py` - Rate-limited demo version
- `examples/test_parameter_flooding.py` - Diagnostic for crash
- `examples/test_server_crash.py` - Crash reproduction test
- `examples/test_engine_health.py` - Component isolation test
- `examples/dnb_collab.py` - Failed attempt at collaborative session
- `examples/SEQUENCER_API.md` - Complete API documentation

**Modified:**

- `CLAUDE.md` - Added project purpose and examples
- `examples/acid_journey_demo.py` - Fixed rapid parameter updates

## 💡 Key Insights/Learnings

- Pyo DSP graphs break silently when flooded with parameter updates
- Human audio perception maxes at 20Hz updates anyway
- Project is about musical conversation, not code generation
- Sequencer runs autonomously once started, doesn't need constant management
- Research agents are invaluable for understanding existing code

## 🔧 Technical Notes

- Parameter update safe rate: 10-20Hz maximum
- D&B beat running: `cd examples && python -c "..." &` (PID 94bba5)
- Engine monitoring: Check engine_status.txt for audio level and gate activity
- Use `add_track()` not `set_track_pattern()` for PolySequencer

## 📊 Progress Metrics

- Crash Issue Resolution: 100%
- Project Understanding: 100%
- Collaborative Music Implementation: 30%
- Context Window at Handoff: 90%
