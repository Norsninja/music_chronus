# Session Handoff: 8-Voice Expansion and Composition Creation

**Created**: 2025-01-09  
**From Session**: claude-opus-4-1  
**To**: Next Chronus Instance  
**Context Window**: 61% - Active

## üéØ Critical Context

Successfully implemented configurable voice count (CHRONUS_NUM_VOICES) enabling 1-16 voices. Created multiple genre compositions demonstrating 8-voice polyphony. System fully operational for live demo.

## ‚úÖ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Configurable Voice Count Implementation

- Added CHRONUS_NUM_VOICES environment variable support
- Modified engine_pyo.py for dynamic voice allocation (1-16 voices)
- Preserved special routing (acid on voice2, LFOs on 2/3)
- Updated monitoring, schema, and save/load for N voices
- Tested and verified with 8 voices

### 2. Musical Compositions Created

- anthem_breakbeat_8voice.py - Stadium DnB at 174 BPM with crowd vocals
- digital_dreams.py - Cyberpunk liquid DnB journey at 170 BPM
- Both scripts use all 8 voices effectively with structured sections
- Demonstrated real-time collaborative music creation via bash commands

### 3. Documentation and Schema Updates

- Engine_Parameters.json updated with 8 voice instances
- OSC Quick Reference synchronized
- Git commit and push completed successfully

## üöß Current Working State

### What IS Working:

- ‚úÖ 8-voice polyphony - All voices accessible and functional
- ‚úÖ Dynamic voice allocation - CHRONUS_NUM_VOICES environment variable
- ‚úÖ Noise generators - White/pink/brown integrated in Voice class
- ‚úÖ Master limiter - Protecting output at -3dB threshold
- ‚úÖ Composition scripts - Both anthem and digital dreams running perfectly
- ‚úÖ Pattern save/load - Works with all 8 voices

### What is PARTIALLY Working:

- ‚è≥ Schema export - osc/type parameter missing in export (functionality works)

### What is NOT Working:

- ‚ùå Nothing critical broken

### Known Issues:

- üêõ Schema registry not showing osc/type parameter in exports (cosmetic issue)

## üö® Next Immediate Steps

1. **Live Demo Preparation**
   - Ensure CHRONUS_NUM_VOICES=8 is set before starting engine
   - Run anthem_breakbeat_8voice.py or digital_dreams.py for demo
   - Use bash commands to build tracks collaboratively

2. **Collaborative Music Session**
   - Use chronusctl.py commands for discovery
   - Build tracks incrementally with OSC commands
   - Utilize Task agent for complex composition help

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

**Created:**

- `anthem_breakbeat_8voice.py` - Full anthem breakbeat composition
- `digital_dreams.py` - Cyberpunk liquid DnB composition
- `pyo_modules/limiter.py` - Master limiter module

**Modified:**

- `engine_pyo.py` - Dynamic voice allocation
- `pyo_modules/voice.py` - Noise generators added
- `Engine_Parameters.json` - Updated with 8 voices

## üí° Key Insights/Learnings

- Task agent with subagent_type general-purpose useful for composition structure
- Safety limits critical: voice amp ‚â§0.3, ADSR sustain ‚â•0.1
- Windows encoding issues with emojis in Python scripts
- Collaborative music creation effective with incremental OSC commands

## üîß Technical Notes

Engine must be started with environment variable:
- Windows: `set CHRONUS_NUM_VOICES=8` then `python engine_pyo.py`
- Linux/Mac: `CHRONUS_NUM_VOICES=8 python engine_pyo.py`

Key OSC commands for demo:
- `/seq/add [track_id] [voice_id] [pattern] [freq] [filter] [notes]`
- `/mod/voiceN/param [value]` for sound design
- `/pattern/save [slot]` and `/pattern/load [slot]` for presets

## üìä Progress Metrics

- Phase/Sprint Progress: Voice expansion 100%, Compositions 100%
- Tests Passing: All functional tests pass
- Context Window at Handoff: 61%
