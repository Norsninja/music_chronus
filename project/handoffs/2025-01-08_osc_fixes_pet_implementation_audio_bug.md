# Session Handoff: OSC Fixes, Pet Implementation, and Critical Audio Bug

**Created**: 2025-01-08  
**From Session**: claude-opus-4-1  
**To**: Next Chronus Instance  
**Context Window**: 58% - Approaching limit

## 🎯 Critical Context

Fixed all OSC handler return value issues causing type errors, implemented Chronus Pet visualizer feature, created 3 original compositions. Critical audio engine failure discovered when using distortion - audio completely stops at mild distortion levels (0.26 drive), requiring engine restart.

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 1. OSC Handler Fixes

- Identified lambdas returning values causing pythonosc encoding errors
- Created proper handler methods for all problematic routes
- Fixed: /seq/update/pattern, /seq/update/notes, /seq/remove, /seq/clear, /seq/start, /seq/stop, /seq/bpm, /seq/swing
- All commands now execute without type errors

### 2. Chronus Pet Implementation

- Added animated pet to visualizer that reacts to music quality
- 6 states: sleeping, waking, vibing, dancing, raving, transcendent
- Musical scoring based on spectrum balance, voice activity, parameter changes
- Fixed NaN handling in visualizer to prevent crashes
- Pet successfully responds to musical complexity

### 3. Music Creation System

- Created ChronusOSC wrapper class for consistent command interface
- Documented OSC command format rules (single values, lists, empty lists)
- Created 3 original compositions: Techno Journey, Acid Dreams, Industrial Nightmare
- First two songs work perfectly, third exposes critical bug

## 🚧 Current Working State

### What IS Working:

- ✅ OSC communication - All handlers properly fixed, no type errors
- ✅ ChronusOSC wrapper - Clean interface for all commands
- ✅ Visualizer with Pet - Displays spectrum, levels, pet animations
- ✅ Basic compositions - Songs without heavy distortion work fine
- ✅ Pattern save/load - Atomic operations functioning

### What is PARTIALLY Working:

- ⏳ NaN handling - Visualizer handles NaN but engine still generates them
- ⏳ Distortion module - Works at very low levels but causes audio failure

### What is NOT Working:

- ❌ Audio engine with distortion - Complete audio failure at drive > 0.26
- ❌ Industrial/heavy compositions - Cannot use distortion without crash

### Known Issues:

- 🐛 Audio engine fails at Bar 3 of Industrial Nightmare - No error messages, audio just stops
- 🐛 Engine continues running but produces no sound - Only restart recovers

## 🚨 Next Immediate Steps

1. **Research codebase with codebase-researcher agent**
   - Investigate DistortionModule implementation
   - Check DSP chain for feedback loops
   - Examine spectrum analyzer for NaN generation

2. **Use technical-planner to design fix**
   - Plan audio protection mechanisms
   - Design limiter/compressor before distortion
   - Create monitoring system for audio health

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

**Created:**

- `chronus_osc.py` - Clean OSC wrapper class
- `OSC_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Command format documentation
- `chronus_song_acid_dreams.py` - Working composition
- `chronus_song_industrial_nightmare.py` - Composition that triggers bug
- `project/handoffs/2025-01-08_audio_engine_crash_bug.md` - Bug documentation
- `test_osc_fix.py` - OSC handler test script

**Modified:**

- `engine_pyo.py` - Added 8 handler methods, fixed route mappings
- `visualizer.py` - Added ChronusPet class, NaN protection

## 💡 Key Insights/Learnings

- OSC handlers must never return values, even None
- Audio engine vulnerable to specific parameter combinations, not just extreme values
- Distortion at 0.26 + sub-bass frequencies causes complete audio failure
- NaN values propagate through DSP chain from distortion/resonance interaction

## 🔧 Technical Notes

Engine fails consistently with: distortion drive=0.26, mix=0.23, voice1 freq=45Hz, pattern='X...X...X...X...'
No error messages in engine output. Audio "squelches" then silence. OSC still responsive.

## 📊 Progress Metrics

- Phase/Sprint Progress: Visualizer 100%, OSC fixes 100%, Audio stability 30%
- Tests Passing: OSC commands work, visualizer stable, 2/3 songs playable
- Context Window at Handoff: 58%
