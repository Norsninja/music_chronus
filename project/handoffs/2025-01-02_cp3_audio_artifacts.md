# Session Handoff: CP3 Router Audio Artifacts Investigation

**Created**: 2025-01-02 18:30  
**From Session**: Chronus Nexus  
**To**: Next Chronus Instance  
**Context Window**: 90% - Critical

## 🎯 Critical Context

CP3 router audio generation is functionally complete but produces audible artifacts ("gritty" sound). Root cause identified by Senior Dev: v3 worker lacks deadline scheduling, causing uneven buffer production that creates audio grain/warble.

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Fixed CP3 Router Audio Generation

- Removed per-buffer prepare() call that was resetting module state
- Added lazy work buffer allocation for dynamically created modules
- Cleaned up duplicate helper method definitions
- Implemented standby readiness gate
- Result: Router generates audio with correct RMS values

### 2. Comprehensive Testing and Documentation

- All unit tests passing (15/15)
- Created test_musical_demo.py for live audio testing
- Documented results in cp3_test_results_report.md
- Discovered audio quality issue during live testing

## 🚧 Current Working State

### What IS Working:

- ✅ Router mode audio generation - Produces correct RMS values
- ✅ Dynamic module creation via OSC - All patch commands functional
- ✅ DAG-based signal routing - Modules connect and process correctly
- ✅ Slot switching - Failover works without dropouts

### What is PARTIALLY Working:

- ⏳ Audio quality - Functionally correct but has "gritty" artifacts
- ⏳ Worker pacing - Free-running instead of deadline scheduled

### What is NOT Working:

- ❌ Clean sine wave generation - All audio has grain/warble artifacts

### Known Issues:

- 🐛 Worker uses time.sleep(0.0001) instead of deadline scheduling - Causes uneven buffer production
- 🐛 Parameter updates only at buffer boundaries - May cause zipper noise

## 🚨 Next Immediate Steps

1. **Implement Deadline Scheduling in v3 Worker**
   - Mirror v2's pattern from supervisor_v2_slots_fixed.py lines 165-225
   - Add buffer_period calculation and next_buffer_time tracking
   - Expected: Clean sine waves without artifacts

2. **Add Min/Max Monitoring**
   - Add clipping detection to verbose output
   - Check if values exceed [-1.0, 1.0] range

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

**Created:**

- `/docs/cp3_router_audio_fix_report.md` - Complete fix documentation
- `/docs/cp3_test_results_report.md` - Test results with audio issue noted
- `/test_musical_demo.py` - Musical demonstration script
- `/MANUAL_TEST_GUIDE.md` - Interactive testing guide

**Modified:**

- `src/music_chronus/module_host.py` - Removed prepare(), added lazy allocation
- `src/music_chronus/supervisor_v3_router.py` - Uses helpers, needs deadline scheduling

## 💡 Key Insights/Learnings

v3 worker free-runs with time.sleep(0.0001) causing uneven buffer timing. Audio callback repeats stale buffers when new ones aren't ready, creating perceived grain. v2 solved this with deadline scheduling - compute buffer_period, track next_buffer_time, sleep until target minus epsilon.

## 🔧 Technical Notes

Deadline scheduling pattern from v2:
```python
buffer_period = BUFFER_SIZE / SAMPLE_RATE
next_buffer_time = time.monotonic() + buffer_period
# In loop:
if current_time >= next_buffer_time - 0.001:
    # Process and write buffer
    next_buffer_time += buffer_period
    if next_buffer_time < current_time - 0.1:  # Reset if too far behind
        next_buffer_time = current_time + buffer_period
```

## 📊 Progress Metrics

- Phase 3 Progress: 95%
- Tests Passing: 15/15
- Context Window at Handoff: 90%
