# Session Handoff: CP3 Track A Polish Implementation

**Created**: 2025-09-03  
**From Session**: Chronus Nexus  
**To**: Next Chronus Instance  
**Context Window**: 50% - Approaching limit

## üéØ Critical Context

Implemented Senior Dev's Track A polish to eliminate popping artifacts. Fixed prime timeout bug (per-worker queues), added instrumentation revealing ring starvation (occ=0 events) as root cause of pops. Proactive fill partially implemented, needs completion.

## ‚úÖ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Prime Timeout Bug Fixed

- Implemented per-worker patch queues eliminating race conditions
- All patch commands now route to standby worker only
- Multi-commit test passed, slots alternate correctly
- Result: No more prime timeouts, swaps reliable

### 2. Senior Dev's Instrumentation Added

- occ0/1k counter tracks ring emptying per 1000 callbacks
- PortAudio underflow/overflow counters
- Enhanced STATS: `occ=X, seq=Y, none=Z%, occ0/1k=N, underflow=U, overflow=O`
- Result: Root cause identified - ring hits occ=0 causing pops

### 3. Environment-Driven Tuning Knobs

- CHRONUS_LEAD_TARGET (default 2)
- CHRONUS_MAX_CATCHUP (default 2)
- CHRONUS_EARLY_MARGIN_MS (default 2)
- CHRONUS_KEEP_AFTER_READ (default 2)
- CHRONUS_PREFILL_BUFFERS (default 4)
- CHRONUS_PRIME_TIMEOUT_MS (default 500)

## üöß Current Working State

### What IS Working:

- ‚úÖ Prime mechanism - Per-worker queues, no race conditions
- ‚úÖ Audio playback - 512/32 config, 0.0-0.1% none-reads
- ‚úÖ Router/patches - Multi-commit cycles work reliably
- ‚úÖ Instrumentation - occ0/1k metric identifies ring starvation

### What is PARTIALLY Working:

- ‚è≥ Proactive fill - Logic added but incomplete in worker loop
- ‚è≥ Clean audio - Works but pops when occ=0 (~1/1000 callbacks)

### What is NOT Working:

- ‚ùå Production-ready audio - Pops persist from ring starvation

### Known Issues:

- üêõ Ring frequently hits occ=0 despite low none-reads - Causes audible pops
- üêõ Proactive fill needs completion - Must bypass timing when occ==0

## üö® Next Immediate Steps

1. **Complete Proactive Fill Implementation**
   - Add logic in worker loop: if occ==0, produce one buffer immediately
   - Don't advance next_deadline for this emergency buffer
   - File: src/music_chronus/supervisor_v3_router.py lines 305-315

2. **Run Test Matrix B-D**
   - Matrix B: LEAD_TARGET=3, MAX_CATCHUP=3
   - Matrix C: Add EARLY_MARGIN_MS=3
   - Matrix D: KEEP_AFTER_READ=3, PREFILL=5
   - Target: occ0/1k ‚â§1, no audible pops

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

**Created:**

- `/docs/cp3_prime_timeout_bug_report.md` - Bug analysis
- `/docs/cp3_prime_fix_implementation.md` - Fix documentation
- `/docs/cp3_senior_dev_improvements.md` - Improvement plan
- `/docs/cp3_track_a_polish_test_results.md` - Matrix A results
- `/tests/cp3_debugging/test_prime_fix.py` - Verification test

**Modified:**

- `/src/music_chronus/supervisor_v3_router.py` - Prime fix, instrumentation, env knobs
- Test files reorganized into `/tests/integration/`, `/tests/manual/`, `/tests/cp3_debugging/`

## üí° Key Insights/Learnings

- Ring starvation ‚â† none-reads: Can have perfect callback timing but still pop
- occ0/1k metric crucial: Shows ring health independent of callback success
- WSL2 timing jitter requires buffer cushion maintenance
- Per-worker queues essential to prevent race conditions

## üîß Technical Notes

Matrix A baseline results:
- occ0/1k=1 (ring hits zero ~1/1000 callbacks)  
- none-reads=0.0-0.1% (excellent)
- underflow/overflow=0 (no PortAudio errors)
- Pops correlate with occ=0 events

Senior Dev's acceptance: occ0/1k‚â§1, none‚â§0.5%, no audible pops, 60-min stable

## üìä Progress Metrics

- Phase/Sprint Progress: Track A 80% (instrumentation done, tuning remains)
- Tests Passing: Prime fix validated, soak test 30min complete
- Context Window at Handoff: 50%
