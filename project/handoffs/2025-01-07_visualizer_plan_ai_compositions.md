# Session Handoff: Terminal Visualizer Planning and AI Music Compositions

**Created**: 2025-01-07  
**From Session**: claude-opus-4-1  
**To**: Next Chronus Instance  
**Context Window**: 90% - Near limit

## 🎯 Critical Context

Completed major features (LFO, slide, recording) and created first AI musical compositions. Technical-planner agent created comprehensive terminal visualizer implementation plan. System ready for visualizer development.

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Audio Features Completed

- LFO modulation (LFO1→voice2 filter, LFO2→voice3 amplitude)
- Voice portamento/slide using Port object (0-1.5s range)
- Master recording capability via Server.recstart()/recstop()
- All features integrated with schema registry

### 2. AI Musical Compositions

- Created "Temporal Flow" - atmospheric electronic piece
- Created "Progressive House" - full arrangement built layer by layer
- Demonstrated sequencer capabilities with dynamic pattern changes
- Video recorded and uploaded to YouTube: https://youtu.be/u0oMbckURcc

### 3. Terminal Visualizer Planning

- Created technical-planner agent for implementation planning
- Generated comprehensive plan at project/research/terminal_visualizer_implementation_plan_2025-01-07.md
- Defined architecture: separate process monitoring OSC
- Specified Rich library for UI with 8-bit aesthetic

## 🚧 Current Working State

### What IS Working:

- ✅ All 4 voices with sine/saw/square waveforms
- ✅ TB-303 acid filter on voice2
- ✅ LFO modulation system
- ✅ Portamento/slide on all voices
- ✅ Master recording to WAV files
- ✅ Sequencer with pattern updates and dynamic control
- ✅ Schema registry self-documentation

### What is PARTIALLY Working:

- ⏳ /seq/remove command - expects list not string argument

### What is NOT Working:

- ❌ Nothing broken currently

### Known Issues:

- 🐛 pythonosc requires list for multiple args: send_message('/seq/add', ['track', 'voice1', 'pattern'])

## 🚨 Next Immediate Steps

1. **Begin Visualizer Implementation Phase 1**
   - Create basic Rich UI scaffold
   - Setup OSC listener on port 5005
   - Implement panel layout

2. **Add Engine Broadcast**
   - Modify engine_pyo.py to add FFT analyzer
   - Broadcast audio data on port 5006

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

**Created:**

- `project/research/terminal_visualizer_implementation_plan_2025-01-07.md` - Complete implementation plan
- `recordings/progressive_house_layered.wav` - AI composition
- `recordings/temporal_flow_chronus_nexus.wav` - AI composition
- `test_slide.py` - Portamento test suite
- `test_recording.py` - Recording test suite

**Modified:**

- `engine_pyo.py` - Added recording methods and OSC routes
- `pyo_modules/voice.py` - Added Port object for slide
- `README.md` - Added AI Compositions section with YouTube link

## 💡 Key Insights/Learnings

- pythonosc send_message requires list for multiple arguments, not individual params
- pyo has no Record object - use Server.recstart()/recstop() instead
- Port object provides exponential smoothing ideal for portamento
- Sequencer pattern updates enable dynamic composition building

## 🔧 Technical Notes

Visualizer will monitor OSC at 5005, receive broadcast data at 5006. Engine modifications needed at lines 845-865 (add FFT) and 880-898 (broadcast data). Use Rich library with Table/Panel/Live components.

## 📊 Progress Metrics

- Phase/Sprint Progress: 100% for audio modules
- Tests Passing: All manual tests successful
- Context Window at Handoff: 90%
