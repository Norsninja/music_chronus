# AI Context Curator v3 - Session Handoff
Date: 2025-08-30
Session: Complete v3 refactor, bug fixes, and automated builds

## Project Status
AI Context Curator is now fully operational with v3.0.3 released. The application is a lightweight Electron clipboard manager for maintaining context between AI coding sessions.

## Completed Work This Session

### 1. Fixed Critical Bugs
- Main prompt save button not updating display after save (ui.js:290-296)
- Save button not disappearing after cell content save (ui.js:500-510)
- Project creation showing false error notification (ui.js:178 - removed duplicate updateProjectSelector call)
- Memory leak in expandAll() method (ui.js:608-620)

### 2. GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Initial workflow failed with 403 Forbidden errors when electron-builder tried auto-publishing
- Fixed by completely rewriting workflow to separate build from release
- Added --publish never flag via build-only script in package.json
- Updated all actions from deprecated v3 to v4
- Successfully building and releasing for Windows, Mac, Linux automatically

### 3. Documentation Updates
- Simplified README from 200+ lines to 107 lines
- Focused on actual use case: session continuity management, not debugging snippets
- Created DEVELOPMENT.md with full technical documentation
- Created QUICK_REFERENCE.md with developer cheat sheet
- Added BUILD.md with build instructions

### 4. Architecture
Current v3 modular structure:
- main.js: Electron main process
- src/app.js: Application initialization
- src/store.js: Data persistence via localStorage
- src/ui.js: UI management and event handling
- src/utils.js: Helper functions (createPreview, showNotification)

### 5. Build Configuration
- electron-builder configured for Windows portable exe, Mac dmg, Linux AppImage
- Personal build script (build-personal.sh) for including pre-loaded data
- Public build script (build-public.sh) for clean builds
- Wine installed in WSL for cross-platform Windows builds

## Current State

### Working Features
- Multi-project support with dropdown selector
- Main prompt with save/cancel functionality
- Context cells with CRUD operations
- Copy to clipboard with selection
- Collapse/expand all functionality
- Auto-save to localStorage
- User notifications for all operations
- Data persistence across app updates
