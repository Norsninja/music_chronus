# Session Handoff: Noise Generators and Master Limiter Integration

**Created**: 2025-01-09  
**From Session**: claude-opus-4-1  
**To**: Next Chronus Instance  
**Context Window**: 90% - Near limit

## 🎯 Critical Context

Successfully integrated noise generators (white/pink/brown) into Voice architecture and added master limiter for protection. Schema registry needs osc/type parameter visibility fix but functionality works perfectly.

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Noise Generator Integration

- Added Noise, PinkNoise, BrownNoise to Voice class oscillators
- Extended Selector from 3 to 6 waveform sources (0-5)
- Implemented amplitude calibration (0.7x white, 0.85x pink, 1.0x brown)
- Updated validation and schema documentation in Voice.get_schema()
- Created working breakbeat drums with real noise

### 2. Master Limiter Implementation

- Created LimiterModule using PyO's Compress (20:1 ratio, -3dB threshold)
- Integrated into signal chain before final output
- Fixed parameter type errors (outputAmp=boolean, knee=integer)
- Prevents clipping and engine crashes from loud transients

### 3. Research Process Completed

- Deployed three agents for comprehensive research
- Created implementation plan following existing patterns
- Verified PyO has native noise generators
- Documented in project/research/ directory

## 🚧 Current Working State

### What IS Working:

- ✅ All 6 waveform types (sine, saw, square, white/pink/brown noise) - Verified via testing
- ✅ Master limiter protecting engine - No more crashes from resonance
- ✅ Breakbeat drums with noise - Snare, hi-hat sound authentic
- ✅ Phoenix Scars composition - Variable scope bugs fixed, plays complete
- ✅ Music-chronus-performer agent - Updated with safety patterns

### What is PARTIALLY Working:

- ⏳ Schema export - Exports file but missing osc/type parameter in output
- ⏳ chronusctl.py schema command - Prints to engine console not client

### What is NOT Working:

- ❌ Schema registry visibility - osc/type parameter not appearing in exported schema
- ❌ Environment variable CHRONUS_EXPORT_SCHEMA - Not persisting on Windows

### Known Issues:

- 🐛 Schema export missing some Voice parameters - Functionality works, just not visible
- 🐛 Gate must be closed manually when triggering - ADSR needs gate off for release

## 🚨 Next Immediate Steps

1. **Fix schema registry collection**
   - Investigate why osc/type not in exported schema
   - Check how engine collects parameters from Voice.get_schema()

2. **Continue collaborative music session**
   - Use new noise generators for better drums
   - Build more complex patterns with breakbeat

- `test_phoenix_scope.py`, `test_phoenix_scope_fixed.py` - Variable scope tests

**Modified:**

- `pyo_modules/voice.py` - Added noise oscillators, extended Selector, updated schema
- `engine_pyo.py` - Added limiter import and integration, temp schema export fix
- `chronus_song_phoenix_scars.py` - Fixed variable scope issues
- `.claude/agents/music-chronus-performer.md` - Added safety patterns and warnings

## 💡 Key Insights/Learnings

- PyO's native noise generators work perfectly for drum synthesis
- Master limiter essential for stability with noise + high resonance
- Variable scope issues common in long compositions - use instance variables
- Schema registry auto-updates but export mechanism needs investigation
- Audio crashes often from clipping at startup or sustained high resonance

## 🔧 Technical Notes

Noise oscillator parameters:
- White noise: mul=0.7 (compensates for 3dB louder)
- Pink noise: mul=0.85 (1.5dB louder)
- Brown noise: mul=1.0 (matches tonal levels)

Limiter settings:
- Threshold: -3dB (headroom before limiting)
- Ratio: 20:1 (hard limiting)
- Attack: 5ms (catches transients)
- Release: 50ms (smooth recovery)

Critical safety limits:
- Voice amplitude: ≤ 0.3
- ADSR sustain: ≥ 0.1 (never 0.0)
- Distortion drive: ≤ 0.3
- Filter resonance: ≤ 2.5 with noise

## 📊 Progress Metrics

- Phase/Sprint Progress: Noise integration 100%, Schema fix 20%
- Tests Passing: All functional tests pass
- Context Window at Handoff: 90%
