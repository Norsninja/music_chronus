# Session Handoff: Buffer Size Mismatch and Python DSP Viability

**Created**: 2024-12-18  
**From Session**: Chronus Nexus  
**To**: Next Chronus Instance  
**Context Window**: 85% - High usage

## 🎯 Critical Context

Investigated audio clicking caused by worker process unable to keep up with audio callback (31% buffer deficit). After increasing buffer size to 1024, encountered buffer size mismatch between AudioRing (512) and workers (1024). Workers crash immediately with shape mismatch error.

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Root Cause Identification

- Diagnosed clicking as ring buffer starvation (workers produce 68% of needed buffers)
- Proved ADSR and SimpleSine are NOT the cause
- Identified worker loop inefficiency and Python overhead as bottlenecks

### 2. Configuration Updates

- Changed BUFFER_SIZE from 512 to 1024 in .env.windows
- Added buffer prefill mechanism
- Implemented OSC /mod/*/* handlers
- Reordered worker loop to prioritize buffer production

### 3. Buffer Mismatch Discovery

- Found AudioRing hardcoded to use 512 samples
- Workers try to write 1024 samples → shape mismatch error
- Attempted fix by setting env var before AudioRing import

## 🚧 Current Working State

### What IS Working:

- ✅ Audio callback performance - <0.03ms average
- ✅ WASAPI integration - Zero underruns
- ✅ OSC server - Functioning on port 5005

### What is PARTIALLY Working:

- ⏳ Worker processes - Start but crash on buffer mismatch
- ⏳ Configuration loading - Reads 1024 but AudioRing uses 512

### What is NOT Working:

- ❌ Buffer production - Workers produce 0 buffers due to crash
- ❌ Audio output - No sound due to no buffers
- ❌ AudioRing/Worker synchronization - Shape mismatch (1024) vs (512)

### Known Issues:

- 🐛 AudioRing imports before env var set - Gets default 512 instead of 1024
- 🐛 Worker heartbeat=1 - Workers die immediately after starting
- 🐛 31% buffer deficit at 512 samples - Python too slow

## 🚨 Next Immediate Steps

1. **Fix AudioRing Buffer Size**
   - Verify env var is set BEFORE supervisor_v2_slots_fixed import
   - Consider modifying AudioRing to accept buffer_size parameter
   - Test workers can write to ring without shape error

2. **Research Python DSP Viability**
   - Investigate pyo, pyFluidSynth as alternatives
   - Consider C extension for critical DSP path
   - Evaluate if multiprocessing overhead is fundamental blocker

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

**Created:**

- `WINDOWS_PORT_FINDINGS.md` - Comprehensive investigation results
- `test_buffer_priority.py` - Diagnostic for buffer production
- `test_working_pattern.py` - OSC pattern tests
- `adsr_analog.py` - RC-based ADSR (worked but didn't fix clicks)

**Modified:**

- `supervisor_windows.py` - Worker loop reordering, OSC handlers, config loading
- `.env.windows` - BUFFER_SIZE changed to 1024

## 💡 Key Insights/Learnings

- Python multiprocessing has ~15ms overhead per buffer at 512 samples
- Buffer size must be >1024 for Python to keep up
- The clicking was never DSP math - always scheduling/performance
- AudioRing buffer size is determined at import time, not runtime

## 🔧 Technical Notes

- AudioRing gets BUFFER_SIZE from supervisor_v2_slots_fixed.py line 38
- Must set CHRONUS_BUFFER_SIZE env var BEFORE importing AudioRing
- Worker shape mismatch: `could not broadcast input array from shape (1024,) into shape (512,)`
- At 512 samples: 10.7ms deadline, worker takes ~15ms = 31% deficit

## 📊 Progress Metrics

- Phase/Sprint Progress: Blocked on buffer mismatch
- Tests Passing: 0 (workers crash)
- Context Window at Handoff: 85%
