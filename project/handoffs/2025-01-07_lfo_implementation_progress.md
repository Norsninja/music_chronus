# Session Handoff: LFO Implementation Progress

**Created**: 2025-01-07 19:30  
**From Session**: Chronus Nexus Audio Modules Sprint  
**To**: Next Chronus Instance  
**Context Window**: 8% - Near Limit

## 🎯 Critical Context

LFO modules implemented but require testing and completion. Engine starts without errors after fixing pyo LFO static waveform type limitation.

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Complete Oscillator Waveform System

- Implemented Sine/Saw/Square waveforms using Selector pattern
- Added click-free switching with equal-power crossfade
- Created comprehensive test suite and committed to repository
- OSC routes: `/mod/voiceN/osc/type <0|1|2>`

### 2. Master Insert Distortion Module

- Implemented DistortionModule using pyo Disto (4x faster than tanh)
- Added drive, mix, tone controls with equal-loudness mixing
- Integrated into signal chain between mixer and effects
- OSC routes: `/mod/dist1/drive|mix|tone`
- Pattern save/load integration complete

### 3. LFO Module Infrastructure

- Created LFO module with research-validated architecture
- Fixed pyo LFO static waveform type limitation
- Integrated into engine with fixed routing: LFO1→Voice2 filter, LFO2→Voice3 amp
- Added OSC routing and schema registry entries
- Pattern save/load support implemented

## 🚧 Current Working State

### What IS Working:

- ✅ Engine startup - No errors after LFO type fix
- ✅ Oscillator waveforms - All three types with click-free switching
- ✅ Distortion module - Complete with transparent controls
- ✅ LFO module creation - Fixed static waveform limitation
- ✅ Voice modulation hooks - Added filter_freq_lfo and amp_lfo inputs

### What is PARTIALLY Working:

- ⏳ LFO integration - Created but needs testing for actual modulation
- ⏳ LFO waveform switching - Currently static (set at creation time)

### What is NOT Working:

- ❌ LFO testing - No test script created yet
- ❌ Dynamic LFO waveform switching - pyo limitation requires workaround

### Known Issues:

- 🐛 pyo LFO class requires static integer waveform type, not signal objects
- 🐛 LFO shape control is API-compatible but currently does nothing

## 🚨 Next Immediate Steps

1. **Test LFO Integration**
   - Create test script for wobble bass (LFO1→Voice2 filter) and tremolo (LFO2→Voice3 amp)
   - Verify modulation is actually working and audible

2. **Complete LFO Implementation**
   - Test all LFO parameters: rate, depth, offset
   - Commit working LFO system to repository

3. **Port/Slide Implementation**
   - Implement slide/glide using Port object with dual-path architecture
   - Add to voice.py for authentic TB-303 style portamento

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

**Created:**

- `pyo_modules/lfo.py` - LFO module with research-optimized implementation
- Research documents in `project/docs/research/` - Complete technical validation

**Modified:**

- `pyo_modules/voice.py` - Added LFO modulation inputs (filter_freq_lfo, amp_lfo)
- `engine_pyo.py` - LFO integration, OSC routing, schema registry, pattern save/load
- `sprint.md` - Updated progress to reflect ahead-of-schedule completion

## 💡 Key Insights/Learnings

- pyo LFO class has static waveform limitation - type parameter must be integer at creation
- Voice modulation requires additive (filter) vs multiplicative (amplitude) approaches
- Research validation prevented major implementation errors
- Fixed routing (v1) simpler than dynamic matrix for initial implementation

## 🔧 Technical Notes

LFO implementation uses fixed routing:
- LFO1 (LFO class, square wave): 0.25Hz → Voice2 filter ±800Hz around base
- LFO2 (Sine class): 4.0Hz → Voice3 amplitude 0.2-1.0 range

Engine tested and starts without errors. Voice modulation architecture ready.

## 📊 Progress Metrics

- Audio Module Sprint Progress: 75% (ahead of schedule)
- Oscillators: 100% complete
- Distortion: 100% complete  
- LFOs: 85% complete (needs testing)
- Context Window at Handoff: 8%
