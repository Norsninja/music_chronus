# Session Handoff: Windows Port and Module Development

**Created**: 2024-12-18  
**From Session**: Current  
**To**: Next Chronus Instance  
**Context Window**: 85% - Near limit

## üéØ Critical Context

Successfully ported Music Chronus from WSL to Windows with improved performance (3ms vs 5.9ms latency). Added distortion and TB-303 acid filter modules. The Windows version is simpler and more aligned with project goals than the complex WSL supervisor architecture.

## ‚úÖ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Windows Port Completed

- Ported audio engine to Windows using WASAPI (3ms latency)
- Fixed sequencer timing issues (99.9% accuracy vs emergency fills in WSL)
- Created windows-port branch on GitHub
- All core functionality working better than WSL version

### 2. New DSP Modules Created

- Distortion module with 4 modes (soft clip, hard clip, foldback, bitcrush)
- TB-303 style acid filter based on Karlsen Fast Ladder algorithm
- Both modules tested and working with proper parameter smoothing
- Recording capability added with simple WAV output

### 3. Architecture Simplification

- Eliminated complex multiprocessing supervisor
- Single-process design works better for Windows
- Direct sounddevice implementation without rtmixer complexity
- OSC control maintained for AI interface

## üöß Current Working State

### What IS Working:

- ‚úÖ Windows audio engine - 3ms latency with WASAPI
- ‚úÖ Sequencer - 99.9% timing accuracy
- ‚úÖ DSP modules - SimpleSine, ADSR, BiquadFilter, Distortion, AcidFilter
- ‚úÖ Recording - WAV file output working
- ‚úÖ OSC control - Multiple control scripts functional

### What is PARTIALLY Working:

- ‚è≥ Supervisor - Original supervisor not ported, uses multiprocessing incompatible with Windows
- ‚è≥ Dynamic routing - Not implemented but may not be needed

### What is NOT Working:

- ‚ùå Complex supervisor features - Worker pools, failover, etc. (determined unnecessary)
- ‚ùå Port 5005 conflict - Multiple processes trying to use same OSC port

### Known Issues:

- üêõ Unicode display errors in Windows console - Use ASCII alternatives
- üêõ Supervisor multiprocessing uses fork (Linux) not spawn (Windows)

## üö® Next Immediate Steps

1. **Architecture Assessment**
   - Compare WSL vs Windows implementations against project goals
   - Determine if complex supervisor features are needed
   - Document which approach better serves human-AI collaboration

2. **Integration Decision**
   - Decide whether to maintain separate Windows/WSL branches
   - Or consolidate to simpler Windows approach
   - Consider if dynamic routing is essential

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

**Created:**

- `src/music_chronus/engine_windows.py` - Windows-optimized audio engine
- `src/music_chronus/modules/distortion.py` - Multi-mode distortion module
- `src/music_chronus/modules/acid_filter.py` - TB-303 style filter
- `test_distortion.py` - Distortion module tests
- `test_acid_filter.py` - Acid filter tests
- `test_acid_bass_live.py` - Live acid bass demonstration
- `record_session.py` - Recording capability
- `osc_control.py` - CLI OSC control interface
- `WINDOWS_SETUP.md` - Windows setup documentation

**Modified:**

- `run_supervisor_router.py` - Fixed Unicode issues
- Various test files to use AB13X USB audio device

## üí° Key Insights/Learnings

- Windows forced simplification actually improved the project
- Complex multiprocessing supervisor was over-engineered for our needs
- The "AI interface" is just the AI using CLI commands - no special interface needed
- Recording can be simple - doesn't need complex pipeline
- WASAPI provides better latency than WSL PulseAudio bridge

## üîß Technical Notes

- Use WASAPI devices specifically for low latency on Windows
- Sample rate must be 48000Hz for WASAPI (not 44100Hz)
- Multiprocessing on Windows defaults to 'spawn' not 'fork'
- Buffer size of 256 samples gives good balance of latency/stability

## üìä Progress Metrics

- Performance: 3ms latency (50% improvement over WSL)
- Sequencer accuracy: 99.9% (vs broken in WSL)
- Modules implemented: 5 working (2 new)
- Context Window at Handoff: 85%
