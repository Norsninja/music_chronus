# Session Handoff: CP3 Router Integration Status

**Created**: 2025-09-02  
**From Session**: Senior Dev (CP1–CP3)  
**To**: Next Chronus Instance  
**Context Window**: ~85% - Near limit

## 🎯 Critical Context

PatchRouter is integrated and functional behind a feature flag; standby patch building works (create/connect/commit), but audio is silent in CP3 due to two fixable issues in the router execution path: per-buffer prepare() resets module state, and missing work_buffers for dynamically added modules.

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 1. CP1 Foundations

- ParamSpec + BaseModuleV2 with boundary smoothing and zero-allocation processing.  
- Central ModuleRegistry with decorator registration and discovery/lazy loading.  
- Vectorized SimpleSineV2 example; package-relative imports across modules.  
- Result: 33 unit tests passing (params, registry, discovery). 

### 2. CP2 Router Integration

- PatchRouter implemented (Kahn topological order, DFS cycle detection, preallocated edge buffers).  
- ModuleHost supports router-based processing (`use_router=True`) with preallocated work buffers and mix buffer; allocation-free steady state.  
- Non-audio router integration tests added; zero steady-state allocations verified; existing tests remain green. 

### 3. CP3 Supervisor + OSC (v3)

- `supervisor_v3_router.py` created: standby-only router mode (`CHRONUS_ROUTER=1`), `/patch/*` OSC handlers, commit-driven slot swap at buffer boundary.  
- Multiprocessing context mismatch resolved by aligning contexts (default mp).  
- Adopted v2 zero-allocation audio callback pattern (read_latest + last_good + np.copyto).  
- OSC env hardened: `CHRONUS_OSC_HOST/PORT`, Pulse mapping via `CHRONUS_PULSE_SERVER` → `PULSE_SERVER`.

## 🚧 Current Working State

### What IS Working:

- ✅ Patch building via OSC: `/patch/create`, `/patch/connect`, `/patch/commit` on standby.  
- ✅ DAG construction/validation: `get_processing_order()` produces correct order.  
- ✅ Slot swap at boundary: pending_switch + standby_ready triggers swap, failover stats increment.  
- ✅ Router path in ModuleHost: allocation-free with preallocated buffers. 

### What is PARTIALLY Working:

- ⏳ Command routing: `/mod/*/*` and `/gate/*` are received and written to rings; worker drains rings but module param names must match (aliases added; needs verification against all modules).  
- ⏳ Standby readiness: basic ready flag used; should also require ≥1 produced buffer on standby ring before swap. 

### What is NOT Working:

- ❌ Audible output in CP3: silence persists after commit/commands.  
- ❌ Gate behavior: ADSR envelope not opening in router path; likely reset each buffer or no gate reaching module.

### Known Issues:

- 🐛 Per-buffer prepare in router path resets module state each buffer (ADSR gate forced off, sine phase reset).  
- 🐛 Missing work_buffers for dynamically added modules causes zero propagation through graph.  
- 🐛 CI: Non-Audio Tests/Performance Metrics jobs intermittently fail (import path/version mismatch).  
- 🐛 Registry access via `_modules` is brittle; better to expose safe getter.

## 🚨 Next Immediate Steps

1. Remove per-buffer prepare and ensure work buffers
   - In `ModuleHost._process_router_chain`, remove `module.prepare()` inside the per-module loop.  
   - Ensure `work_buffers[module_id]` exists for all router modules: prefer `module_host.router_add_module()` in standby worker when creating modules; otherwise lazily allocate if missing.  
   - Expected outcome: ADSR retains gate/open state; sine maintains phase; non-zero buffers propagate.

2. Validate command application and prime post-commit
   - Confirm OSC param aliases: `frequency→freq`, `resonance→q`.  
   - After `/patch/commit`, send `/mod/<osc>/gain 0.2` and `/gate/<env> 1` to guarantee audible state; verify worker drains rings and `module_host.commands_processed` increments.  
   - Expected outcome: audible output post-swap; RMS > 0.

3. Hardening (quick)
   - Standby readiness: require standby ring `head > 0` before swap.  
   - Add verbose (CHRONUS_VERBOSE=1) RMS logging of osc output and final sink every ~100 buffers during diagnosis.  
   - Replace direct `registry._modules` usage with a helper (non-blocking change).

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

**Created:**

- `src/music_chronus/patch_router.py` - DAG router (Kahn, DFS, preallocated edge buffers).  
- `src/music_chronus/supervisor_v3_router.py` - CP3 supervisor with router, `/patch/*`, and slot swap.  
- `src/music_chronus/module_registry.py` - Central registry with decorator and discovery/lazy load.  
- `src/music_chronus/modules/base_v2.py` - Enhanced base with ParamSpec integration.

**Modified:**

- `src/music_chronus/module_host.py` - Router path, preallocated buffers, mix, command processing at boundaries.  
- `src/music_chronus/modules/simple_sine.py` - `@register_module('simple_sine')`, param names `freq/gain`; vectorized DSP.  
- `src/music_chronus/modules/adsr.py` - `@register_module('adsr')`.  
- `src/music_chronus/modules/biquad_filter.py` - `@register_module('biquad_filter')`.  
- `src/music_chronus/supervisor_v2_slots_fixed.py` - Minor env/OSC hygiene earlier.  
- `docs/*` - Phase 3 research/progress/cp3 AAR; multiprocessing context diagnosis. 

## 💡 Key Insights/Learnings

- Do not call `prepare()` per buffer; it is a lifecycle reset, not a boundary update hook — rely on `process_buffer()`’s internal smoothing.  
- In router mode, dynamic modules must have preallocated per-module output buffers; preallocate on attach or lazily on first use.  
- Maintain param name alignment or provide minimal aliasing at OSC ingress to avoid silent no-ops.  
- Context consistency across mp primitives and processes avoids SemLock errors; make rings context-aware post-CP3.

## 🔧 Technical Notes

- Feature flag: `CHRONUS_ROUTER=1` to enable router path; default is linear chain.  
- OSC env: `CHRONUS_OSC_HOST/PORT` (defaults 127.0.0.1:5005).  
- Pulse mapping: `CHRONUS_PULSE_SERVER` → `PULSE_SERVER` if unset.  
- Standby commit requires warm-up (2–3 buffers) and should require standby ring `head > 0` before swap.  
- CI: Align `pyproject.toml` version with package `__version__=0.3.0` or adjust metrics job; ensure tests import via `music_chronus` with `.../src` on `sys.path`.

## 📊 Progress Metrics

- Phase 3 Progress: ~60% (CP1 + CP2 complete; CP3 in progress).  
- Unit Tests Passing: 33/33 + new router tests.  
- Non-audio router integration tests: PASS.  
- Audio (CP3 router): silent; pending fixes above.  
- Context Window at Handoff: ~85%.
