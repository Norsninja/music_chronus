# Session Handoff: Sequencer Implementation and Timing Fix

**Created**: 2025-09-03  
**From Session**: Chronus Nexus  
**To**: Next Chronus Instance  
**Context Window**: 63% - Approaching limit

## 🎯 Critical Context

Implemented MVP buffer-quantized sequencer for Music Chronus. Core functionality complete but timing has drift issues. Senior Dev provided detailed fix using epoch-based while-loop scheduler that needs implementation.

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Complete Sequencer Implementation

- Created SequencerState dataclass and SequencerManager thread
- Implemented pattern parsing ("x...x..." notation with velocity support)
- Added all OSC handlers (/seq/* commands) to supervisor_v3_router.py
- Integrated with existing CommandRing for dual-slot emission

### 2. Test Coverage and Debugging

- Wrote 14 pattern parsing unit tests (all passing)
- Wrote 12 timing calculation tests (all passing)
- Fixed 4 integration bugs (imports, string/bytes, argument order, method names)
- Created integration test scripts

### 3. Timing Analysis and Initial Fix

- Identified drift issue: accumulating rounding errors
- Attempted epoch-based fix but needs Senior Dev's cleaner implementation
- Generated 9 test recordings showing irregular timing

## 🚧 Current Working State

### What IS Working:

- ✅ Pattern parsing - "x", "X", "." notation with velocities
- ✅ OSC command handling - All /seq/* endpoints functional
- ✅ CommandRing integration - Sends to both slots correctly
- ✅ Queue-based updates - Atomic pattern swaps working
- ✅ Basic sequencing - Events do fire, just with timing drift

### What is PARTIALLY Working:

- ⏳ Timing accuracy - Events fire but rhythm is irregular due to drift
- ⏳ Tempo changes - Apply but may not be on exact boundaries

### What is NOT Working:

- ❌ Steady rhythm - Accumulating drift makes patterns unrecognizable
- ❌ Multi-sequencer sync - Phase alignment untested due to timing issues

### Known Issues:

- 🐛 Timing drift in run() loop - Using delta accumulation instead of absolute positioning
- 🐛 buffers_until_next_step starts at 0 - Causes immediate fire on start

## 🚨 Next Immediate Steps

1. **Implement Senior Dev's timing fix**
   - Replace current run() loop with epoch-based while-loop scheduler
   - See `/home/norsninja/music_chronus/project/docs/sequencer_implementation_progress.md` for Senior Dev's detailed spec
   - Key change: Track `next_step_buffer` and `gate_off_buffer` as absolute indices

2. **Test and validate timing**
   - Run unit tests for buffer calculations
   - Record 10-30s pattern to verify steady rhythm
   - Test tempo changes at boundaries

## 💡 Key Insights/Learnings

- Buffer-quantized timing (±1 buffer) is sufficient for musical sequencing
- Python thread timing works when properly anchored to epoch time
- Accumulating deltas causes drift; absolute positioning from epoch is stable
- Senior Dev's while-loop approach naturally handles catch-up without flooding

## 🔧 Technical Notes

**Senior Dev's timing fix pseudocode:**
```python
current_buffer = int((now - epoch_time) / buffer_period)
while global_next_buffer <= current_buffer:
    for seq in sequencers:
        if global_next_buffer == next_step_buffer:
            # Emit events, advance step
            next_step_buffer += buffers_per_step
        if global_next_buffer == gate_off_buffer:
            # Emit gate off
    global_next_buffer += 1
```

**Environment for testing:**
```bash
export CHRONUS_ROUTER=1
python src/music_chronus/supervisor_v3_router.py
```

## 📊 Progress Metrics

- Phase/Sprint Progress: Sequencer MVP 95% (timing fix remaining)
- Tests Passing: 26/26 unit tests, integration needs timing fix
- Context Window at Handoff: 63%
