# Session Handoff: Phase 0 Testing - IPC-04 Ready for Implementation

**Created**: 2025-08-31  
**From Session**: claude-opus-4-1-20250805  
**To**: Next Chronus Instance  
**Context Window**: 61% - Functional

## üéØ Critical Context

Completed 9/12 Phase 0 tests (75%) including critical architecture decisions. IPC-04 event synchronization specification complete with production-grade design from "Senior Dev Chronus" guidance. Ready to implement lock-free event system.

## ‚úÖ What Was Accomplished

### 1. RT-03 Architecture Decision Final

- Tested threading vs multiprocessing for DSP operations
- Multiprocessing 5.7x faster for small-buffer audio DSP
- Threading actually slower than sequential for our workload
- Decision: Stick with multiprocessing architecture

### 2. RT-04 Memory Allocation Validation

- Verified allocation-free audio path
- Discovered tracemalloc itself allocates ~800 bytes (not our code)
- Identified NumPy FFT limitation (always allocates, need pyfftw)
- Confirmed pre-allocated buffers with out= parameter work

### 3. IPC-04 Specification Complete

- Researched event synchronization requirements
- Designed ping-pong RTT/2 measurement approach
- Specified socketpair + shared memory architecture
- Defined SPSC ring buffer pattern for lock-free operation

## üöß Current Working State

### What IS Working:

- ‚úÖ Audio latency - 5.9ms via rtmixer
- ‚úÖ Zero buffer underruns - Perfect stability
- ‚úÖ OSC control - 1000 msg/sec at 0.068ms latency
- ‚úÖ Shared memory - 0.042ms transfer time
- ‚úÖ Worker pools - 0.02ms task assignment
- ‚úÖ Memory management - Allocation-free validated

### What is PARTIALLY Working:

- ‚è≥ Only 2-3 workers run in parallel - Memory bandwidth bottleneck identified

### What is NOT Working:

- ‚ùå NumPy FFT - Always allocates memory, need pyfftw replacement

### Known Issues:

- üêõ Musical accuracy tests (MUS-01 to MUS-04) deferred - Module-specific, not framework tests

## üö® Next Immediate Steps

1. **Implement IPC-04 Test**
   - Use socketpair for wakeups, shared memory for data
   - Test under load (2 DSP workers + 100 OSC msg/sec)
   - Target: p50 < 0.05ms, p95 < 0.2ms, p99 < 0.5ms

2. **Complete Phase 0**
   - PROC-03: Process failure isolation
   - PROC-04: Resource cleanup
   - Then move to Phase 1: Core Audio Engine

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

**Created:**

- `/tests/test_RT04_memory_allocation.py` - Memory allocation detection
- `/tests/specs/IPC-04_event_synchronization.feature` - Event sync specification
- `/tests/results/RT-03_results.md` - Architecture decision documentation
- `/tests/results/RT-04_results.md` - Memory test results
- `/docs/architecture_decision_multiprocessing_final.md` - Final architecture decision

**Modified:**

- `/sprint.md` - Updated to 56.25% complete (9/16 tests)
- `/project/docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` - Refined vision as collaborative sandbox
- `/CLAUDE.md` - Updated progress and key learnings

## üí° Key Insights/Learnings

1. Small audio buffers (256 samples) completely change parallelism dynamics vs large arrays
2. Empirical testing essential - theory suggested threading, reality proved multiprocessing
3. Senior Dev Chronus guidance invaluable - production-grade patterns for IPC-04
4. Lock-free architecture mandatory for audio callbacks - no mutexes allowed
5. Sample-based timing eliminates cross-process clock drift issues

## üîß Technical Notes

- Environment: MKL_NUM_THREADS=1, OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 for predictable testing
- Use socketpair() for wakeups, not data transfer
- SPSC ring buffers per worker for lock-free command passing
- Apply parameter changes at buffer boundaries, not mid-buffer
- Hybrid wakeup: poll in audio callback, select() in control thread

## üìä Progress Metrics

- Phase 0 Progress: 75% (9/12 tests, skipping MUS tests)
- Tests Passing: 9/9 implemented
- Context Window at Handoff: 61%
