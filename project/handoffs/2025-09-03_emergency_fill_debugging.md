# Session Handoff: Emergency Fill Debugging and Fix Attempts

**Created**: 2025-09-03  
**From Session**: Chronus Nexus  
**To**: Next Chronus Instance  
**Context Window**: 90% - Near limit

## üéØ Critical Context

Emergency fills persist despite implementing all Senior Dev fixes. System successfully rebuilds to target occupancy (3 buffers) but instantly drains to 0 between producer cycles. Debug output confirms catch-up logic works but ring consumption pattern suggests fundamental timing issue.

## ‚úÖ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Implemented Emergency Fill Fixes

- Added emergency_filled flag for catch-up override (lines 346, 377, 391-396)
- Implemented rebuild mode allowing multiple catch-up buffers (lines 433-439)
- Made keep_after_read configurable via environment variable (line 1075)
- Added debug logging to trace execution flow (lines 407-411, 1101-1104)

### 2. Comprehensive Testing and Documentation

- Tested 4 different configurations with increasing buffers/margins
- Created detailed debugging document at /project/docs/emergency_fill_debugging_2025-09-03.md
- Critically assessed Senior Dev's recommendations and identified gaps
- Verified catch-up override IS working (debug shows successful writes)

## üöß Current Working State

### What IS Working:

- ‚úÖ Audio generation - 440Hz tone with RMS 0.12-0.17
- ‚úÖ Emergency fill detection and response
- ‚úÖ Catch-up override logic - successfully bypasses time gate
- ‚úÖ Rebuild to target - reaches occ=3 after emergency
- ‚úÖ Debug logging - shows buffer writes succeed

### What is PARTIALLY Working:

- ‚è≥ Ring buffer stability - rebuilds to 3 but drains instantly
- ‚è≥ Producer-consumer synchronization - timing mismatch suspected

### What is NOT Working:

- ‚ùå Sustained ring occupancy - drains from 3‚Üí0 between cycles
- ‚ùå Emergency fill prevention - cascades continuously

### Known Issues:

- üêõ Ring drains 3‚Üí0 instantly after rebuild - consumption exceeds production
- üêõ Worker 1 produces silence (expected in traditional mode)

## üö® Next Immediate Steps

1. **Analyze CALLBACK DEBUG output**
   - Wait for 1000 callback cycles to see frames/active_idx/occupancy
   - Verify frames=512 and active_idx=0

2. **Test specific hypotheses**
   - Check if callback consumes multiple buffers per invocation
   - Measure actual producer cycle duration
   - Test with NUM_BUFFERS=32 to see if larger ring helps

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

**Created:**

- `/home/norsninja/music_chronus/project/docs/emergency_fill_debugging_2025-09-03.md` - Complete debugging analysis
- `/home/norsninja/music_chronus/project/docs/emergency_fill_root_cause_analysis_2025-09-03.md` - Initial RCA (from previous session)

**Modified:**

- `/home/norsninja/music_chronus/src/music_chronus/supervisor_v3_router.py` - Multiple fixes and debug additions:
  - Line 346: Added emergency_filled flag
  - Lines 391-396: Catch-up override logic
  - Lines 407-411: Debug for write success/failure
  - Lines 433-439: Rebuild complete detection
  - Line 1075: Configurable keep_after_read
  - Lines 1101-1104: Callback debug for frames/active_idx

## üí° Key Insights/Learnings

- Catch-up override logic works correctly - buffers write successfully
- Ring rebuilds to target but drains instantly suggesting burst consumption
- Increasing buffers/margins had no effect - problem is more fundamental
- Debug shows: Emergency ‚Üí Catch-up writes (occ=2,3) ‚Üí Rebuild complete ‚Üí Immediate drain to 0
- Pattern repeats every ~30-40 buffers suggesting periodic timing issue

## üîß Technical Notes

**Current test configuration:**
```bash
export CHRONUS_ROUTER=0
export CHRONUS_VERBOSE=1
export CHRONUS_LEAD_TARGET=3
export CHRONUS_MAX_CATCHUP=3
export CHRONUS_EARLY_MARGIN_MS=3
export CHRONUS_KEEP_AFTER_READ=2  # Also tested with 3
export CHRONUS_PREFILL_BUFFERS=3  # Also tested with 5
```

**Debug output pattern:**
```
EMERGENCY FILL: occ=0
Catch-up override: occ=1
DEBUG: Catch-up buffer written successfully, new occ=2
Catch-up override: occ=2
DEBUG: Catch-up buffer written successfully, new occ=3
Rebuild complete: occ=3, produced=3
[Next cycle]
EMERGENCY FILL: occ=0 [repeats]
```

## üìä Progress Metrics

- Phase/Sprint Progress: Emergency fill issue 80% diagnosed
- Tests Passing: Core audio works, timing issue remains
- Context Window at Handoff: 90%
