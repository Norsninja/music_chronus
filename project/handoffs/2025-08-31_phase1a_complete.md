# Session Handoff: Phase 0 Testing & Phase 1A Audio Engine Complete

**Created**: 2025-08-31  
**From Session**: Chronus-Session-831  
**To**: Next Chronus Instance  
**Context Window**: 57% - Healthy

## 🎯 Critical Context

Completed Phase 0 infrastructure testing (12/16 tests, 75%) and Phase 1A audio engine implementation. System now generates continuous 440Hz sine wave with zero underruns for 60+ seconds. Ready for Phase 1B control integration.

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Phase 0 Testing Completed (12/16 tests)

- IPC-04: Event synchronization validated (84μs p50, 190μs p99)
- PROC-03: Process failure isolation architecture validated (ProcessPoolExecutor unsuitable)
- PROC-04: Resource cleanup verified (zero leaks across 50 cycles)
- Deferred MUS tests until audio engine exists

### 2. Phase 1A Audio Engine Implemented

- AudioBackend interface defined for future rtmixer support
- SoundDeviceBackend implemented with callback discipline
- 60-second stability test passed with zero underruns
- Callback performance: mean 0.023ms, max 0.53ms

## 🚧 Current Working State

### What IS Working:

- ✅ Audio engine - Continuous 440Hz sine generation with phase accumulator
- ✅ Metrics tracking - Lock-free callback timing and underrun counting
- ✅ CPU monitoring - Separate thread tracking at 1Hz
- ✅ Clean start/stop - Resources properly managed

### What is PARTIALLY Working:

- ⏳ ProcessPoolExecutor crash recovery - Architecture validated but needs Option B (manual Process management)
- ⏳ Sprint documentation - Needs update from 12/16 to reflect Phase 1A completion

### What is NOT Working:

- ❌ OSC control path - Not implemented yet (Phase 1B)
- ❌ Worker pool DSP modules - Not implemented yet (Phase 1C)
- ❌ Musical accuracy tests - Deferred until modules exist

### Known Issues:

- 🐛 Buffer count ~5% high in 60s test - Non-critical timing drift
- 🐛 rtmixer not suitable for continuous generation - Using sounddevice for now

## 🚨 Next Immediate Steps

1. **Update sprint.md**
   - Mark Phase 0 as 75% complete (infrastructure validated)
   - Mark Phase 1A as complete
   - Plan Phase 1B (control integration)

2. **Implement Phase 1B: Control Integration**
   - Add OSC control thread
   - Lock-free parameter exchange
   - Apply frequency changes at buffer boundaries

## 💡 Key Insights/Learnings

- ProcessPoolExecutor is fundamentally unsuitable for fault-tolerant real-time systems
- Python achieves real-time audio through careful architecture: pre-allocation, no GIL interaction, lock-free patterns
- Multiprocessing 5.7x faster than threading for small-buffer DSP despite NumPy releasing GIL
- Hot-standby pattern provides <2ms failover but needs manual Process management
- sounddevice callback model perfect for continuous generation, rtmixer better for scheduled buffers

## 🔧 Technical Notes

- Environment: PULSE_SERVER=tcp:172.21.240.1:4713 for WSL2 PulseAudio
- Buffer size: 256 samples @ 44.1kHz = 5.8ms
- Callback discipline: NO allocations, NO syscalls, NO locks in audio callback
- Phase accumulator: Wrap at 1000*2π to prevent numerical issues
- Use array.array('d') for lock-free metrics between threads

## 📊 Progress Metrics

- Phase 0 Progress: 75% (12/16 tests)
- Phase 1A: 100% Complete
- Tests Passing: 12/16 (MUS tests deferred)
- Context Window at Handoff: 57%
