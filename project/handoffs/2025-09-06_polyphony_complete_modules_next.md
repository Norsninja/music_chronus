# Session Handoff: Polyphony Complete, DSP Modules Next

**Created**: 2025-09-06  
**From Session**: Chronus Nexus  
**To**: Next Chronus Instance  
**Context Window**: 61% - Healthy

## üéØ Critical Context

Successfully implemented 4-voice polyphony with effects and fixed critical routing bug where effects received Sig(0) instead of audio. Next priority is porting acid_filter and distortion modules to pyo before creating musical demos.

## ‚úÖ What Was Accomplished

### 1. 4-Voice Polyphony Implementation

- Created Voice class with Sig/SigTo parameter smoothing
- Implemented ReverbBus and DelayBus with proper audio routing
- Full OSC schema with backward compatibility
- Fixed critical bug: pass Mix objects at init, not Sig.value assignment

### 2. Headless Sequencer

- Removed all user interaction from poly_sequencer.py
- Implemented autonomous time-based demonstration
- Created genre presets (Techno, Ambient, Dub)
- Added swing, note conversion, velocity modulation

### 3. Project Understanding Correction

- Learned system must be headless for AI control
- No input() or user interaction allowed
- Scripts must run autonomously with defined runtime

## üöß Current Working State

### What IS Working:

- ‚úÖ 4-voice polyphony - All voices playing independently with smoothing
- ‚úÖ Effects routing - Reverb/delay receiving audio correctly after fix
- ‚úÖ Poly sequencer - Fully headless, 96-second autonomous demo
- ‚úÖ OSC control - Full schema implemented with backward compatibility
- ‚úÖ Parameter smoothing - Sig/SigTo preventing zipper noise

### What is PARTIALLY Working:

- ‚è≥ DSP modules - Python implementations exist but need porting to pyo
- ‚è≥ Musical demos - Planned but waiting for acid/distortion modules

### What is NOT Working:

- ‚ùå Acid filter - Not yet ported to pyo
- ‚ùå Distortion - Not yet ported to pyo

### Known Issues:

- üêõ None currently - all critical bugs fixed

## üö® Next Immediate Steps

1. **Port acid_filter to pyo**
   - Use MoogLP for authentic 303 sound
   - Implement envelope modulation of cutoff
   - Add accent boost and drive

2. **Port distortion to pyo**
   - Multiple modes using Disto/Degrade
   - Implement tone control
   - Place in signal chain post-voice, pre-effects

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

**Created:**

- `pyo_modules/voice.py` - Voice class with smoothing
- `pyo_modules/effects.py` - ReverbBus and DelayBus
- `examples/poly_sequencer.py` - Headless polyphonic sequencer
- `examples/test_polyphony.py` - Comprehensive test
- `project/docs/2025-09-06_polyphony_and_sequencer_implementation.md` - Session documentation

**Modified:**

- `engine_pyo.py` - Added 4-voice support and fixed routing
- `sprint.md` - Updated with current priorities

## üí° Key Insights/Learnings

- Effects routing in pyo requires passing PyoObjects directly, not setting Sig.value
- Headless means NO user interaction - scripts must be autonomous
- Parameter smoothing with Sig/SigTo is critical for professional sound
- Senior Dev's review caught critical bugs that testing missed

## üîß Technical Notes

- Use `Mix(signals)` to sum audio, pass directly to effects constructors
- Sig(0) is for numeric parameters, not audio routing
- All demos must be time-based with defined runtime
- CHRONUS_DEVICE_ID environment variable replaces hardcoded device

## üìä Progress Metrics

- Polyphony Implementation: 100%
- Effects Routing: 100% (after fix)
- Sequencer: 100% headless
- DSP Module Porting: 0% (next priority)
- Context Window at Handoff: 61%
