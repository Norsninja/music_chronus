# Session Handoff: Audio System Debug and Fix

**Created**: 2025-09-01  
**From Session**: Chronus_Session_09-01  
**To**: Next Chronus Instance  
**Context Window**: 85% - High usage

## 🎯 Critical Context

Fixed critical audio pipeline bugs that prevented any sound output. System now produces audio but with quality issues (engine-like modulation). CommandRing was truncating Protocol v2 packets at null bytes, and workers were not calling process_commands().

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Identified and Fixed CommandRing Truncation Bug

- CommandRing.read() was calling cmd_data.find(b'\x00') and truncating
- Protocol v2 uses 64-byte binary packets with embedded nulls
- Removed truncation logic in src/music_chronus/supervisor.py line 177-180
- Commands now reach modules intact

### 2. Fixed Missing process_commands() Call

- Workers were queuing commands but never processing them
- Added host.process_commands() before host.process_chain() in supervisor_v2_fixed.py line 239
- ADSR gate now responds correctly

### 3. Resolved Worker Lifecycle Confusion

- "Worker received SIGTERM" messages were from old workers with same ID
- Added PID and timestamp logging for clarity
- Confirmed workers stay alive and healthy

## 🚧 Current Working State

### What IS Working:

- ✅ Audio output - Sound is produced
- ✅ OSC command reception - All commands received correctly
- ✅ Module parameter updates - freq, gain, filter settings apply
- ✅ ADSR gate control - on/off works properly
- ✅ Worker stability - No crashes or unexpected terminations

### What is PARTIALLY Working:

- ⏳ Audio quality - Produces sound but "engine-like" modulation instead of clean tones
- ⏳ OSC server - Works but sometimes reports port 5005 already in use

### What is NOT Working:

- ❌ Clean audio output - Buffer discontinuities cause modulation/distortion
- ❌ Tmux integration - Sessions crash when managed from chat

### Known Issues:

- 🐛 Engine-like sound - Likely AudioRing.read_latest() synchronization issue
- 🐛 Port 5005 conflicts - Lingering processes hold the port

## 🚨 Next Immediate Steps

1. **Fix Audio Quality Issue**
   - Investigate AudioRing.read_latest() synchronization
   - Check for buffer discontinuities or rapid switching
   - Verify only one worker writes to active ring

2. **Add Debug Logging**
   - Log which buffer sequences are read/written
   - Track RMS values through the pipeline
   - Monitor buffer timing

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
- `utils/osc_control.py` - Command-line OSC control utility
- `docs/engine_sound_analysis.md` - Analysis of audio quality issue
- `docs/final_debugging_summary.md` - Complete bug fix documentation
- `archive/debugging_scripts/` - Organized test scripts
- `test_gate_on.py` - Working audio test script

**Modified:**
- `src/music_chronus/supervisor.py` - Fixed CommandRing null-byte truncation
- `src/music_chronus/supervisor_v2_fixed.py` - Added process_commands(), improved logging

## 💡 Key Insights/Learnings

- Binary protocols with embedded nulls require careful handling
- Worker process output can be interleaved causing confusion
- Missing process_commands() call was silent failure
- Audio issues manifest as modulation when buffers are misaligned

## 🔧 Technical Notes

- Run synthesizer in native terminal: `python -m src.music_chronus.supervisor_v2_fixed`
- Set environment: `export PULSE_SERVER=unix:/mnt/wslg/PulseServer`
- Test with: `python utils/osc_control.py test`
- Audio callback reads from self.active_ring only

## 📊 Progress Metrics

- Phase/Sprint Progress: 90%
- Tests Passing: Core functionality working
- Context Window at Handoff: 85%
