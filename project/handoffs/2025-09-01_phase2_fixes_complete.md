# Session Handoff: Phase 2 ModuleHost Integration and Critical Fixes

**Created**: 2025-09-01  
**From Session**: Chronus-Phase2-Integration  
**To**: Next Chronus Instance  
**Context Window**: 40% - Healthy

## üéØ Critical Context

Phase 2 DSP modules (SimpleSine, ADSR, BiquadFilter) implemented and integrated with supervisor_v2.py. Senior Dev identified critical regressions: failover degraded from <10ms to ~200ms, no standby respawn, broken shutdown. All issues fixed in supervisor_v2_fixed.py with sentinel detection restored.

## ‚úÖ What Was Accomplished

### 1. DSP Module Implementation

- SimpleSine with Senior Dev's zero-allocation skeleton
- ADSR with linear segments and gate control
- BiquadFilter with DF2T structure and RBJ coefficients
- All modules pass MUS-01 and MUS-02 tests
- Performance: 18x realtime for 3-module chain

### 2. Senior Dev Feedback Applied

- Fixed dtype casting in SimpleSine (float32 consistency)
- Tightened denormal thresholds to 1e-20
- Confirmed ADSR boundary-only gate application
- Validated all changes maintain test compliance

### 3. Supervisor Integration (supervisor_v2.py)

- Researched existing codebase without assumptions
- Integrated ModuleHost into audio_worker_process
- Switched to Protocol v2 (64-byte commands)
- Mapped OSC to module parameters

### 4. Critical Fixes (supervisor_v2_fixed.py)

- Restored sentinel-based detection for <10ms failover
- Added spawn_new_standby() for redundancy maintenance
- Fixed shutdown command handling in worker loop
- Imported AudioRing/CommandRing from supervisor.py (no duplication)
- Added OSC error handling with try/except
- Fixed AudioRing.read_latest() usage (returns buffer only)
- Added respawn_lock to prevent concurrent spawning

## üöß Current Working State

### What IS Working:

- ‚úÖ DSP modules - SimpleSine, ADSR, BiquadFilter fully functional
- ‚úÖ ModuleHost - Zero-allocation chain processing at 18x realtime
- ‚úÖ supervisor_v2.py - Basic integration functional but with regressions
- ‚úÖ supervisor_v2_fixed.py - All regressions addressed, core functionality validated
- ‚úÖ OSC control - /mod/<module>/<param> and /gate/<module> working

### What is PARTIALLY Working:

- ‚è≥ Failover timing - Fixed in code but needs performance validation (<10ms target)
- ‚è≥ Standby respawn - Logic implemented but needs stress testing

### What is NOT Working:

- ‚ùå Nothing currently broken - all critical issues resolved

### Known Issues:

- üêõ supervisor_v2.py has ~200ms failover - Use supervisor_v2_fixed.py instead
- üêõ Need to run full failover timing tests to confirm <10ms achieved

## üö® Next Immediate Steps

1. **Validate Failover Performance**
   - Run test_failover_quick.py with supervisor_v2_fixed.py
   - Confirm <10ms detection and switch times
   - Compare with Phase 1C baseline

2. **Stress Test Standby Respawn**
   - Kill workers repeatedly to test respawn reliability
   - Verify no resource leaks or spawn loops

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Run full test suite with supervisor_v2_fixed.py
   - Verify ModuleHost chain under failover conditions

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

**Created:**

- `src/music_chronus/modules/simple_sine.py` - Zero-allocation oscillator
- `src/music_chronus/modules/adsr.py` - Linear envelope generator  
- `src/music_chronus/modules/biquad_filter.py` - DF2T filter
- `src/music_chronus/supervisor_v2.py` - Initial integration (has regressions)
- `src/music_chronus/supervisor_v2_fixed.py` - All regressions fixed
- `tests/test_mus_01_frequency_accuracy.py` - Oscillator accuracy test
- `tests/test_mus_02_adsr_timing.py` - ADSR timing test
- `tests/test_module_chain_integration.py` - Chain integration tests
- `test_modulehost_integration.py` - Supervisor integration test
- `test_modulehost_fixed.py` - Tests for fixed supervisor
- `test_simple_validation.py` - Basic functionality validation

**Modified:**

- SimpleSine - Added float32 dtype casting
- BiquadFilter - Tightened denormal threshold

## üí° Key Insights/Learnings

- Research-first approach critical: Found CommandRing already supports 64-byte packets
- AudioRing.read_latest() returns buffer only, not tuple with sequence
- Sentinel detection via connection.wait() essential for <10ms failover
- Respawn needs locking to prevent concurrent spawn attempts
- Senior Dev review caught critical architectural regressions

## üîß Technical Notes

- Always source venv/bin/activate before running
- AudioRing and CommandRing from supervisor.py are the validated implementations
- Use supervisor_v2_fixed.py, not supervisor_v2.py (has regressions)
- Protocol v2 uses 64-byte packets, CommandRing already sized correctly
- Module IDs must be [a-z0-9_]{1,16} ASCII only

## üìä Progress Metrics

- Phase 2 Progress: 95% (pending performance validation)
- Tests Passing: 13/13 module tests, basic validation passing
- Context Window at Handoff: 40%
