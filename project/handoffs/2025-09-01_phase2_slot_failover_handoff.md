# Phase 2 Slot-Based Failover - Session Handoff

**Date**: 2025-09-01  
**Session**: Git sync and documentation update  
**Status**: Documentation complete, ready for archiving

## Summary

Successfully updated all documentation to reflect Phase 2 completion with slot-based failover architecture achieving <50ms audio interruption.

## Completed Tasks

### Commit 1: Promote Supervisor ✅
- Updated `__init__.py` to import from `supervisor_v2_slots_fixed`
- Bumped version to 0.3.0
- Updated Makefile run target

### Commit 2: Documentation Updates ✅
- **README.md**: 
  - Updated status to Phase 2 Complete
  - Added fault tolerance metrics (<50ms failover)
  - Added working OSC commands section
  - Added troubleshooting section
  - Preserved tone, quotes, and vision
- **docs/architecture_slot_failover.md**: 
  - Created comprehensive architecture document
  - Explained slot-based design rationale
  - Documented per-process view rebinding pattern
- **docs/performance_metrics.md**:
  - Updated to v0.3.0
  - Reflected production failover metrics
  - Added link to architecture doc

## Next Steps

### Commit 3: Archive Deprecated Supervisors
Need to move to `archive/deprecated/`:
- supervisor_v2.py
- supervisor_v2_fixed.py
- supervisor_v2_surgical.py (if exists)
- supervisor_v2_graceful.py
- supervisor_v2_failover_fix.py (if exists)
- supervisor_v2_final.py (if exists)
- supervisor_v2_slots.py
- supervisor_v2_slot_based.py

### Commit 4: Update Tests/CI
- Check if any tests import deprecated supervisors
- Update CI configuration if needed

## Key Documentation Points

Preserved the project's character:
- Opening DnB quote remains
- Musical philosophy intact
- Collaborative vision maintained
- Technical achievements celebrated

Added practical information:
- Working OSC command reference
- Troubleshooting for common issues
- Environment variable documentation
- Clear quickstart instructions

## Technical Highlights

The slot-based architecture documentation explains:
- Why rings are tied to slots, not workers
- How per-process view rebinding works
- The command broadcast window during failover
- Deferred cleanup pattern for audio priority

Performance metrics now show:
- <50ms failover (production validated)
- Zero allocations in audio callback
- 100% command continuity
