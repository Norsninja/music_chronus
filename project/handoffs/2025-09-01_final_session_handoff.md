# Session Handoff: Phase 2 Complete - Production Deployment

**Created**: 2025-09-01  
**From Session**: Chronus-Phase2-Final  
**To**: Next Chronus Instance  
**Context Window**: 66% - Healthy

## 🎯 Critical Context

Phase 2 is 100% complete with 2.12ms failover achieved. supervisor_v2_fixed.py is now the production AudioSupervisor. All critical bugs fixed, system ready for tmux musical collaboration.

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Critical Bug Fixes (Morning)

- Fixed command-plane contamination causing spurious respawns
- Improved failover from 2.68ms to 2.12ms
- Eliminated worker reference swap bug
- Added CommandRing.reset() for clean initialization

### 2. Production Deployment (Afternoon)

- Promoted supervisor_v2_fixed.py as main AudioSupervisor
- Archived deprecated supervisor_v2.py
- Updated __init__.py to version 0.2.0
- Modified Makefile targets for production use

### 3. Senior Dev Follow-ups (Evening)

- Created MUS-03 filter cutoff test (-3dB accuracy)
- Added RT guard test (100 msg/s OSC load)
- Implemented CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- Created LFO module (ready for integration)
- Defined NL→OSC mapping specification

## 🚧 Current Working State

### What IS Working:

- ✅ ModuleHost with SimpleSine → ADSR → BiquadFilter chain
- ✅ 2.12ms failover with dual-worker redundancy
- ✅ OSC control on port 5005 (/mod/*, /gate/*)
- ✅ Zero underruns under 100 msg/s load
- ✅ All tests passing (MUS-01/02/03, RT guard)

### What is PARTIALLY Working:

- ⏳ LFO module - Implemented but not integrated into ModuleHost
- ⏳ CI/CD - Active but audio tests skip without device

### What is NOT Working:

- ❌ Nothing currently broken

### Known Issues:

- 🐛 None - all spurious respawn issues resolved

## 🚨 Next Immediate Steps

1. **Tmux Musical Testing**
   - Run `make run` to start synthesizer
   - Test OSC control via tmux commands
   - Verify NL→OSC mapping works

2. **LFO Integration**
   - Add LFO to ModuleHost chain
   - Test modulation routing
   - Create vibrato/tremolo patches

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
- `tests/test_mus_03_filter_cutoff.py` - Filter accuracy test
- `tests/test_rt_guard.py` - Real-time load test
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - CI/CD pipeline
- `src/music_chronus/modules/lfo.py` - LFO module
- `docs/nl_osc_mapping.md` - Natural language mapping
- `docs/performance_metrics.md` - Performance documentation

**Modified:**
- `src/music_chronus/__init__.py` - Version 0.2.0, new imports
- `src/music_chronus/supervisor_v2_fixed.py` - All critical fixes
- `src/music_chronus/supervisor.py` - Added CommandRing.reset()
- `Makefile` - Updated for Phase 2
- `sprint.md` - Marked Phase 2 complete
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated for tmux testing

## 💡 Key Insights/Learnings

- Command-plane isolation critical - mixing shutdown with data caused races
- SIGTERM sufficient for clean shutdown - no command pollution needed
- Worker reference swapping must be atomic with ring swapping
- Senior Dev review caught regression our tests missed

## 🔧 Technical Notes

- Always `source venv/bin/activate` before running
- Use `make run` to start synthesizer (port 5005)
- supervisor_v2_fixed.py is the ONLY supervisor to use
- Protocol v2 uses 64-byte packets
- Module IDs must be [a-z0-9_]{1,16} ASCII only

## 📊 Progress Metrics

- Phase 2 Progress: 100%
- Tests Passing: 18/18
- Context Window at Handoff: 66%
