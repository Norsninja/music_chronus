# Session Handoff: CP3 Router Integration API Mismatches

**Created**: 2025-01-02  
**From Session**: Chronus Nexus  
**To**: Next Chronus Instance  
**Context Window**: 42% - Stable

## 🎯 Critical Context

Supervisor v3 with router support has critical API mismatches that prevent execution. Senior Dev identified method call errors and missing patch building mechanism - v3 calls non-existent methods and lacks actual graph construction in standby worker.

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Phase 3 Module Framework Implementation

- Created ParamSpec metadata system with smoothing algorithms
- Built ModuleRegistry with lazy loading and discovery
- Implemented PatchRouter with Kahn's algorithm for DAG processing
- Added router support to ModuleHost with zero-allocation guarantee

### 2. CP2-CP3 Integration

- ModuleHost router integration behind CHRONUS_ROUTER flag
- Created supervisor_v3_router.py with OSC /patch/* handlers
- Fixed multiprocessing context mismatch (spawn vs fork)
- Created tests for patch flow and router integration

## 🚧 Current Working State

### What IS Working:

- ✅ PatchRouter - DAG management, cycle detection, topological sorting
- ✅ ModuleHost router mode - Process chain with pre-allocated buffers
- ✅ Module registry and discovery - Lazy loading functional
- ✅ Tests - 33 unit tests passing for Phase 3 components

### What is PARTIALLY Working:

- ⏳ supervisor_v3_router - Imports work but has API mismatches
- ⏳ OSC handlers - Collect patch info but don't build actual graph

### What is NOT Working:

- ❌ Audio ring API calls - Using read() instead of read_latest()
- ❌ Command ring API calls - Using is_empty() instead of has_data()
- ❌ Patch building - No mechanism to send patch to standby worker
- ❌ Audio callback - Not using zero-allocation pattern from v2

### Known Issues:

- 🐛 AttributeError on audio_ring.read() - Must use read_latest()
- 🐛 AttributeError on command_ring.is_empty() - Must use has_data()
- 🐛 Patch commands never reach worker - No control channel exists

## 🚨 Next Immediate Steps

1. **Fix API Mismatches**
   - Change audio_ring.read() to read_latest()
   - Change is_empty() to has_data()
   - Adopt v2 audio callback pattern

2. **Implement Patch Building Channel**
   - Add control mechanism to standby worker
   - Route /patch/* commands to actual ModuleHost
   - Build graph before marking ready

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

**Created:**

- `src/music_chronus/param_spec.py` - Parameter metadata system
- `src/music_chronus/module_registry.py` - Module discovery/registration
- `src/music_chronus/patch_router.py` - DAG routing implementation
- `src/music_chronus/supervisor_v3_router.py` - Router-enabled supervisor
- `tests/test_module_host_router_integration.py` - Router tests
- `tests/test_supervisor_patch_flow_dry.py` - Patch flow tests
- `docs/multiprocessing_context_diagnosis.md` - Context issue analysis

**Modified:**

- `src/music_chronus/module_host.py` - Added router support
- `src/music_chronus/modules/base_v2.py` - Enhanced with ParamSpec

## 💡 Key Insights/Learnings

- Multiprocessing contexts must match between shared objects and processes
- API compatibility crucial when extending existing systems
- Patch building requires actual communication channel, not just flag setting
- Zero-allocation patterns must be preserved in audio callbacks

## 🔧 Technical Notes

- Context fix: Changed from mp.get_context('spawn') to mp (default)
- Need to adopt v2's read_latest() and last_good buffer pattern
- Patch building options: CMD_OP_PATCH with payload or separate Queue
- Environment vars: Use CHRONUS_OSC_HOST/PORT for consistency

## 📊 Progress Metrics

- Phase 3 Progress: 60%
- Tests Passing: 40/40 (but supervisor won't run)
- Context Window at Handoff: 42%
