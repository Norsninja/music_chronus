# Session Handoff: Phase 1B Complete, Phase 1C Core Implemented

**Created**: 2025-08-31  
**From Session**: Chronus-Session-831b  
**To**: Next Chronus Instance  
**Context Window**: 56% - Healthy

## 🎯 Critical Context

Phase 1B OSC control integration complete and working - human confirmed hearing music created via headless tmux control. Phase 1C supervisor core implemented with lockstep rendering architecture for zero-gap failover.

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Phase 1B Control Integration Complete

- Implemented OSC control thread with AsyncIO server on port 5005
- Added Python-native lock-free parameter exchange (GIL provides atomicity)
- Achieved headless control via tmux - can create music human can hear
- Stress tested at 100 msg/s with zero underruns (23% apply rate is correct behavior)

### 2. Phase 1C Research and Core Implementation

- Researched sentinel monitoring patterns - 2ms polling achieves <10ms detection
- Incorporated Senior Dev's critical architecture change: audio stays in main process
- Implemented AudioRing buffer with cache-line alignment
- Created DSP worker process with lockstep rendering
- Both workers render identically for instant failover

## 🚧 Current Working State

### What IS Working:

- ✅ Phase 1B headless control - Full OSC control via tmux
- ✅ audio_engine_v3.py - Real-time frequency control with zero underruns
- ✅ Stress testing - Validated at 100 msg/s load
- ✅ AudioRing implementation - Lock-free SPSC with latest-wins policy

### What is PARTIALLY Working:

- ⏳ Phase 1C supervisor - Core implemented but not tested
- ⏳ Worker monitoring - Code complete but needs integration testing

### What is NOT Working:

- ❌ Failover testing - Not yet executed
- ❌ OSC integration in supervisor - Needs connection to Phase 1B patterns
- ❌ SHM registry - Designed but not implemented

### Known Issues:

- 🐛 Buffer count ~5% high in 60s test - Non-critical timing drift
- 🐛 audio_supervisor.py imports need venv activation

## 🚨 Next Immediate Steps

1. **Test Phase 1C Supervisor**
   - Combine audio_supervisor.py and audio_supervisor_part2.py
   - Run basic startup test
   - Verify both workers render in lockstep

2. **Test Failover Scenarios**
   - Kill primary worker and verify instant switch
   - Measure failover timing
   - Confirm zero audio gap

## 💡 Key Insights/Learnings

- GIL provides atomicity for Python-native types - no array.array needed for simple float/int
- Audio must stay in main process - workers only do DSP (critical for zero-gap failover)
- Lockstep rendering with broadcast commands keeps workers synchronized
- 23% apply rate at 100 msg/s is correct - boundary-only application working as designed
- connection.wait() with 2ms polling achieves reliable <10ms death detection

## 🔧 Technical Notes

- Always activate venv: `source venv/bin/activate`
- tmux session 'music' has audio engine running
- PULSE_SERVER=tcp:172.21.240.1:4713 for WSL2 audio
- Use python3 explicitly, not python
- Senior Dev validated all architectural decisions

## 📊 Progress Metrics

- Phase 1B: 100% Complete
- Phase 1C: 40% Complete (research done, core implemented, testing needed)
- Tests Passing: 14/16 (MUS tests deferred)
- Context Window at Handoff: 56%
