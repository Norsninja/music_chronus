# Session Handoff: Emergency Fill Fix Implementation

**Created**: 2025-09-03  
**From Session**: Chronus Nexus  
**To**: Next Chronus Instance  
**Context Window**: 95% - Near limit

## üéØ Critical Context

Fixed root cause of emergency fill cascade: ADSR gate wasn't triggered (wrong method) and worker scheduling didn't advance deadline after emergency fill. Option A fix implemented but still showing emergency fills in test output.

## ‚úÖ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Root Cause Analysis of Emergency Fills

- Identified ADSR gate never triggered due to using `set_param("gate", 1.0)` instead of `set_gate(True)`
- Fixed worker role confusion (both workers were building default chain)
- Documented findings in `/home/norsninja/music_chronus/project/docs/emergency_fill_root_cause_analysis_2025-09-03.md`

### 2. Implemented Senior Dev's Option A Fix

- Added deadline advancement after emergency fill (line 366 supervisor_v3_router.py)
- Added emergency tracking counters and stats reporting
- Fixed worker initialization logic for router vs traditional modes

### 3. Fixed Sequencer Timing (Earlier Work)

- Replaced delta-accumulation with epoch-based timing in sequencer.py
- Added catch-up limit and safety measures
- Sequencer currently disabled pending audio fix completion

## üöß Current Working State

### What IS Working:

- ‚úÖ Audio generation - 440Hz tone plays with RMS ~0.12-0.17
- ‚úÖ Worker roles - Active has chain, standby is empty (correct)
- ‚úÖ ADSR gate trigger - Using correct `set_gate(True)` method
- ‚úÖ Prefill produces non-zero RMS values

### What is PARTIALLY Working:

- ‚è≥ Emergency fills - Still occurring despite Option A fix implementation
- ‚è≥ Worker scheduling - Deadline advancement added but not preventing cascades

### What is NOT Working:

- ‚ùå Emergency fill prevention - Still cascading after latest fix
- ‚ùå Sequencer - Disabled until audio pipeline stable

### Known Issues:

- üêõ Emergency fills persist despite deadline advancement - Need to verify fix is executing
- üêõ Environment variables might not be taking effect - User may not have exported them

## üö® Next Immediate Steps

1. **Debug Option A Implementation**
   - Add debug logging to verify deadline is actually advancing
   - Check if emergency fill branch is continuing to main loop
   - Verify environment variables are exported and read correctly

2. **Validate Fix Effectiveness**
   - Run with CHRONUS_VERBOSE=1 to see stats output
   - Monitor emergency/1k ratio over 60 seconds
   - Check if occ stabilizes at lead_target (3)

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

**Created:**

- `/home/norsninja/music_chronus/project/docs/emergency_fill_root_cause_analysis_2025-09-03.md` - Complete analysis of emergency fill issue
- `/home/norsninja/music_chronus/project/docs/sequencer_timing_issue_2025-09-03.md` - Sequencer timing analysis

**Modified:**

- `/home/norsninja/music_chronus/src/music_chronus/supervisor_v3_router.py` - Multiple fixes: ADSR gate, worker roles, emergency fill deadline, instrumentation
- `/home/norsninja/music_chronus/src/music_chronus/sequencer.py` - Epoch-based timing implementation (currently disabled)

## üí° Key Insights/Learnings

- ADSR requires `set_gate()` method, not `set_param("gate", ...)`
- Worker `use_router` parameter was conflating system mode with worker role
- Emergency fill must advance deadline to allow main loop to continue producing
- Python multiprocessing is sensitive to initialization order

## üîß Technical Notes

**Environment Variables Required:**
```bash
export CHRONUS_ROUTER=0
export CHRONUS_VERBOSE=1
export CHRONUS_LEAD_TARGET=3
export CHRONUS_MAX_CATCHUP=3
export CHRONUS_EARLY_MARGIN_MS=3
```

**Option A Fix Location:**
- Line 366 in supervisor_v3_router.py: `next_deadline = max(next_deadline, now) + buffer_period`
- Line 374: `now = time.perf_counter()` to recompute for next iteration

**Sequencer Integration:**
- Currently commented out at lines 52, 493-498, 884-894, 1096-1098
- Ready to re-enable once audio stable

## üìä Progress Metrics

- Phase/Sprint Progress: Audio pipeline 90% (emergency fills remaining)
- Tests Passing: 26/26 sequencer unit tests
- Context Window at Handoff: 95%
