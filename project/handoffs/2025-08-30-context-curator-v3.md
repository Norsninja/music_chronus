# AI Context Curator v3 Refactor Session

## Session Summary
Developed AI Context Curator from v1 to v3 with major architectural improvements.

## Current State

### Completed Work
1. **Version 1.0**: Basic single-project Electron app with cells management
   - localStorage persistence
   - Collapsible cells
   - Copy to clipboard functionality
   - Initial GitHub release

2. **Version 2.0**: Multi-project support
   - Project dropdown with create/delete
   - Data migration from v1
   - Electron-compatible (no prompt/confirm dialogs)
   - Visual confirmations for delete operations

3. **Version 3.0**: Complete refactor for stability
   - Modular architecture (store.js, ui.js, app.js)
   - Event-driven data store
   - Differential rendering (no full DOM rebuilds)
   - Event delegation for performance
   - Clean CSS with animations
   - Proper separation of concerns

### Active Issues
1. Main prompt save button may not be updating correctly after edit
2. Line breaks in main prompt now display correctly but needs testing
3. Overall v3 testing needed for stability

### File Structure
```
context-manager/
├── index.html (v3 active)
├── index-old.html (v2 backup)
├── style.css (v3 active)
├── style-old.css (v2 backup)
├── src/
│   ├── store.js (data layer with events)
│   ├── ui.js (UI renderer with differential updates)
│   └── app.js (main controller)
├── renderer-v2.js (v2 monolithic, 850 lines)
└── renderer.js (v1 obsolete)
```

### Technical Details
- Using localStorage with 5-10MB capacity (sufficient for 1000s of cells)
- Electron app with preload script for clipboard access
- Auto-migration from v1→v2→v3 data formats
- Event system prevents unnecessary re-renders
- Typical usage: 5-10 projects with 10-20 cells each

### Repository
- GitHub: https://github.com/Norsninja/ai-context-curator
- Public repository with MIT license
- Two commits: Initial v1.0 and v2.0 multi-project

### Next Session Focus
1. Test and fix main prompt save functionality
2. Comprehensive v3 testing
3. Verify data migration works correctly
4. Consider committing v3 if stable
5. Possible feature: Export/import individual projects

### Key Design Decisions
- localStorage over file system (simpler, sufficient capacity)
- Inline editing over modals (Electron compatibility)
- Visual confirmations over dialogs
- Event-driven architecture over direct DOM manipulation
- Differential rendering over full re-renders
