# Session Handoff: Terminal Visualizer Implementation Complete

**Created**: 2025-01-08  
**From Session**: claude-opus-4-1  
**To**: Next Chronus Instance  
**Context Window**: 85% - Near limit

## 🎯 Critical Context

Completed terminal visualizer with working spectrum analyzer using bandpass filters instead of FFT to avoid WxPython dependency. All visualizer features functional, committed and pushed to repository.

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Terminal Visualizer Implementation

- Created visualizer.py with Rich UI framework
- Implemented 3-panel layout (levels, spectrum, messages)
- Real-time OSC monitoring on port 5006
- 20 FPS refresh rate with thread-safe data buffers

### 2. Spectrum Analyzer Solution

- Discovered Spectrum object requires WxPython
- Implemented 8-band analyzer using ButBP filters
- Frequencies: 63Hz, 125Hz, 250Hz, 500Hz, 1kHz, 2kHz, 4kHz, 8kHz
- Each band uses Follower object for smooth response

### 3. Critical Fixes

- Voice levels clamped to 0.0-1.0 (was exceeding 1.0)
- OSC /viz messages now display in panel (were bypassing)
- Spectrum data broadcasting working (was silently failing)

## 🚧 Current Working State

### What IS Working:

- ✅ Terminal visualizer - Full Rich UI with all panels
- ✅ Spectrum analyzer - 8 bands responding to frequencies
- ✅ Voice meters - Individual levels for 4 voices, properly clamped
- ✅ OSC broadcast - Engine sending /viz/levels and /viz/spectrum at 10Hz
- ✅ Message display - All OSC messages including /viz shown

### What is PARTIALLY Working:

- ⏳ None - all features fully functional

### What is NOT Working:

- ❌ None - all issues resolved

### Known Issues:

- 🐛 None currently

## 🚨 Next Immediate Steps

1. **Test visualizer with music sessions**
   - Record video with spectrum analyzer
   - Verify all frequencies tracked correctly

2. **Performance optimization**
   - Monitor CPU usage during extended sessions
   - Adjust spectrum scaling factors if needed

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

**Created:**

- `visualizer.py` - Main terminal visualizer application
- `test_phase2.py` - Phase 2 test script
- `test_all_fixes.py` - Comprehensive fix verification
- `check_spectrum_broadcast.py` - OSC broadcast diagnostic
- `diagnose_osc.py` - OSC communication diagnostic

**Modified:**

- `engine_pyo.py` - Added bandpass spectrum, OSC broadcast, voice clamping
- `requirements.txt` - Added Rich library
- `sprint.md` - Added Week 2 visualizer tasks

## 💡 Key Insights/Learnings

- WxPython dependency message was in console output all along
- Bandpass filter approach better than FFT for music visualization
- pythonosc requires list for multiple arguments: send_message('/seq/add', ['track', 'voice1', 'pattern'])
- Port conflicts can cause silent fallback to status-file-only mode

## 🔧 Technical Notes

Engine broadcasts to port 5006, visualizer listens on same port. Spectrum uses 8 ButBP filters with Follower objects. Voice levels use PeakAmp with clamping. Debug output removed after verification.

## 📊 Progress Metrics

- Phase/Sprint Progress: 100% for visualizer
- Tests Passing: All manual tests successful
- Context Window at Handoff: 85%
