# Session Handoff: Test-Driven Foundation and Architecture Pivot

**Created**: 2025-08-30 23:00:00  
**From Session**: claude-opus-4-1-20250805  
**To**: Next Chronus Instance  
**Context Window**: 66% - Still functional

## 🎯 Critical Context

Completed Phase 0 foundation testing for Python modular synthesizer. Discovered that on-demand process spawning is not viable (672ms with libraries) - must use worker pool pattern instead.

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Validated Core Performance (4 tests passed)

- RT-01: rtmixer audio latency = 5.9ms (target <20ms)
- IPC-01: OSC control latency = 0.068ms (target <5ms)  
- IPC-03: Shared memory transfer = 0.042ms with zero-copy
- PROC-01: Process spawn requires worker pools (cold spawn 672ms unacceptable)

### 2. Established Test-First Methodology

- Research-first approach using new technical-research-scout agent
- BDD-style specifications before implementation
- Caught critical issues before production code
- All tests have concrete acceptance criteria

### 3. Architectural Pivot Decision

- Original design: spawn processes on-demand
- Problem: 672ms with numpy+scipy imports
- Solution: Pre-warmed worker pool pattern
- Documented in architecture_decision_worker_pools.md

## 🚧 Current Working State

### What IS Working:

- ✅ rtmixer - C-level audio callbacks with 5.9ms latency
- ✅ OSC - AsyncIO server with <0.1ms message latency
- ✅ Shared memory - Zero-copy audio transfer via mp.Array
- ✅ Test framework - Comprehensive specs and implementations

### What is PARTIALLY Working:

- ⏳ Process architecture - Works but requires worker pools not on-demand spawn
- ⏳ Module creation - Need to implement pool assignment logic

### What is NOT Working:

- ❌ On-demand process spawning - Too slow for real-time
- ❌ Worker pool implementation - Not built yet

### Known Issues:

- 🐛 scipy.signal import takes 490ms - must pre-import in workers
- 🐛 Fork method fast (3ms) but unsafe with threads/OSC

## 🚨 Next Immediate Steps

1. **Implement Worker Pool Architecture**
   - Create pool with 8 pre-warmed workers
   - Pre-import all libraries in initializer
   - Test assignment latency (<10ms target)

2. **Complete Phase 0 Testing**
   - RT-02: 60-second sustained audio test
   - PROC-02: Worker pool assignment timing
   - Integration test: Full signal path

3. **Begin Phase 1 Implementation**
   - Audio Server with rtmixer
   - Base Module class with IPC
   - Session Manager with pool

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

**Created:**

- `/tests/specs/*.feature` - BDD test specifications (RT-01, IPC-01, IPC-03, PROC-01)
- `/tests/test_*.py` - Test implementations with measurements
- `/tests/results/*.md` - Detailed test results and analysis
- `/docs/architecture_decision_worker_pools.md` - Architecture pivot documentation
- `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `.gitignore` - Project structure
- `README.md` - Project documentation

**Modified:**

- `sprint.md` - Updated with test results and architecture changes
- `CLAUDE.md` - Identity context (minor updates)

## 💡 Key Insights/Learnings

1. Research-first methodology essential - saved us from building wrong architecture
2. Python multiprocessing spawn with libraries is prohibitively slow (600-700ms)
3. Worker pools are mandatory for real-time performance
4. rtmixer + OSC + shared memory combo gives excellent latency (~6ms total)
5. Fork is 20x faster than spawn but unsafe with threads
6. Test specifications before code catches critical issues early

## 🔧 Technical Notes

- Use forkserver start method for safety + performance
- Pool size = 2 * CPU cores for headroom
- Pre-import numpy, scipy.signal, pythonosc in worker init
- Use mp.Array(ctypes.c_float) for shared audio buffers
- When passed to subprocess, array is raw ctypes not wrapper
- AsyncIOOSCUDPServer best for control plane

## 📊 Progress Metrics

- Phase/Sprint Progress: 25% (4/16 Phase 0 tests complete)
- Tests Passing: 4/4 (with architectural adjustments)
- Context Window at Handoff: 66%
