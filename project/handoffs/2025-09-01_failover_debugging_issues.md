# Failover Debugging Session - Issues Document

**Date**: 2025-09-01  
**Session**: Failover Testing and Debugging  
**Created by**: Chronus (after multiple failures)  
**For**: Senior Dev and Mike  
**Status**: BLOCKED - Need Senior Dev assistance

## Problem Statement

The failover mechanism in `supervisor_v2_surgical.py` is not working. When the primary worker is killed, audio stops completely instead of switching to the standby worker.

## Test Results

### What Was Tested
Ran `test_failover.py` which:
1. Started 440Hz tone via OSC
2. Killed primary worker process with SIGKILL
3. Expected: Audio continues with <50ms glitch
4. Actual: Audio stopped completely (only brief "blip" heard)

### Current Behavior
- Primary worker produces audio successfully
- Standby worker appears to be running
- When primary is killed, no failover occurs
- Audio output stops entirely

## Attempted Fix - FAILED

Created `supervisor_v2_failover_fix.py` with intended fixes:
1. Added worker reference tracking (`active_worker_ref`, `standby_worker_ref`)
2. Changed command sending to go to BOTH workers (keep standby in sync)
3. Modified `handle_primary_failure()` logic
4. Fixed spawn_standby_worker() to check actual active index

### Errors Made (7+ attempts to run)

1. **IndentationError** in ADSR module line 83
   - Removed print statements, left empty if blocks
   - Fixed by adding `pass` statements

2. **IndentationError** in ADSR module line 144
   - Multiple empty if blocks throughout the file
   - Fixed by adding more `pass` statements

3. **SyntaxError** line 328 - expected 'except' or 'finally'
   - Had try block without except/finally
   - Removed unnecessary try block

4. **SyntaxError** line 350 - invalid syntax on 'else:'
   - Had two else blocks in sequence (logic error)
   - Restructured if/else logic

5. **ImportError** - cannot import AudioRing from engine
   - Tried to import from wrong module
   - AudioRing/CommandRing are defined in supervisor.py, not engine.py
   - Copied class definitions into file

Each "fix" was done hastily without proper understanding of the codebase.

## Root Causes of My Failures

1. **Insufficient code understanding** - Didn't study the original supervisor_v2_surgical.py carefully enough
2. **Rushed fixes** - Made quick changes without reviewing full context
3. **Import confusion** - Didn't understand where classes were defined
4. **Copy/paste errors** - When copying code, didn't maintain proper control flow
5. **No incremental testing** - Should have verified each change before proceeding

## What Needs Investigation

### Key Questions for Senior Dev

1. **Why isn't the standby worker producing audio?**
   - Is it actually processing buffers?
   - Is the ring buffer switch happening?
   - Is `pending_switch` mechanism working?

2. **Is the monitor thread detecting failure correctly?**
   - Logs show "Active worker died" message?
   - Is `handle_primary_failure()` being called?

3. **Is the audio callback switching rings?**
   - Does `active_ring` change from primary to standby?
   - Is `pending_switch` being set and cleared?

4. **Are both workers configured identically?**
   - Same module chain?
   - Same parameters?
   - Same audio processing?

## Files Involved

- **Working original**: `/home/norsninja/music_chronus/src/music_chronus/supervisor_v2_surgical.py`
- **My broken attempt**: `/home/norsninja/music_chronus/src/music_chronus/supervisor_v2_failover_fix.py`
- **Test script**: `/home/norsninja/music_chronus/test_failover.py`
- **ADSR module**: `/home/norsninja/music_chronus/src/music_chronus/modules/adsr.py` (has debug code removed)

## Recommendation

The failover mechanism needs careful debugging by someone who understands the architecture. My attempted fixes have made things worse. Recommend:

1. Start fresh from `supervisor_v2_surgical.py`
2. Add detailed logging to understand the failover sequence
3. Verify standby worker is actually producing audio
4. Test ring buffer switching in isolation
5. Consider simpler failover approach if current one is too complex

## Apology

I apologize for wasting time with repeated errors. I should have:
- Created this document after the first error
- Asked for help sooner
- Been more careful and methodical
- Actually understood the code before trying to fix it

Mike and Senior Dev should take over from here.
