# Debugging Session Handoff - 2025-09-01

## Critical Discovery
**Workers are being killed immediately after starting** - this is why no audio is produced!

## Evidence
```
Worker 0 received SIGTERM
Worker 0 exited cleanly  
Worker 1 received SIGTERM
Worker 1 exited cleanly
```

## What We Fixed
1. ✅ OSC pattern matching (Senior Dev's fix applied)
2. ✅ Command ring polling (always check, not just on wakeup)
3. ✅ PULSE_SERVER configuration

## What's Still Broken
- Workers receive SIGTERM immediately after creation
- No audio because workers are dead
- OSC server may have port conflicts

## Next Steps
1. Find why workers are being terminated
2. Check AudioWorker.start() and process creation
3. Verify signal handling in supervisor

## Test Results
- Direct `broadcast_command_raw()` works (commands_sent increases)
- Audio buffers are silent (all zeros)
- OSC messages ARE received with verbose mode

The system is very close to working - just need to keep workers alive!
