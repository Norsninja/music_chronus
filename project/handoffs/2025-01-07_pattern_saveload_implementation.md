# Session Handoff: Pattern Save/Load Implementation Started

**Created**: 2025-01-07 18:32  
**From Session**: Chronus Nexus  
**To**: Next Chronus Instance  
**Context Window**: 93% - Critical

## 🎯 Critical Context

Successfully integrated sequencer OSC routes, implemented self-maintaining parameter registry, and began pattern save/load implementation based on Senior Dev's architecture. Pattern directories created, ready for snapshot/apply_snapshot methods.

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Integrated Sequencer OSC Control

- Added all /seq/* routes to engine dispatcher using map_route wrapper
- Created handle_seq_add method with flexible argument parsing
- No more zombie processes - sequencer lives inside engine
- Tested and verified working with musical patterns

### 2. Self-Maintaining Parameter Registry

- Implemented map_route() wrapper that auto-updates registry
- Added unknown route tracking for drift detection
- Created chronusctl.py tool for discovery
- Added test_schema_audit.py for validation
- Registry prevents documentation drift

### 3. Pattern Save/Load Research & Planning

- Technical-research-scout completed comprehensive research
- Senior Dev provided detailed implementation plan
- Created patterns/ directory structure (slots, library, temp, backups)
- Ready to implement SequencerManager.snapshot() and apply_snapshot()

## 🚧 Current Working State

### What IS Working:

- ✅ Engine with integrated sequencer - No zombies, direct voice control
- ✅ Parameter registry - Self-maintaining, live discovery via /engine/schema
- ✅ All /seq/* OSC commands - Add, remove, clear, start, stop, update
- ✅ Acid filter on voice2 - Confirmed working with characteristic squelch
- ✅ Pattern directory structure - Created and ready

### What is PARTIALLY Working:

- ⏳ Pattern save/load - Research complete, architecture defined, implementation started
- ⏳ Acid accent system - Disabled due to signal graph breaks but core filter works

### What is NOT Working:

- ❌ Pattern snapshot methods - Not yet implemented
- ❌ Pattern OSC handlers - Routes not added yet

### Known Issues:

- 🐛 Acid accent system causes signal graph breaks - Currently disabled
- 🐛 Windows WASAPI prevents SuperCollider use - Pyo was correct choice

## 🚨 Next Immediate Steps

1. **Implement SequencerManager.snapshot()**
   - Capture tracks dict with deepcopy for atomicity
   - Include BPM, swing, global_step
   - Return serializable dict

2. **Implement SequencerManager.apply_snapshot()**
   - Clear existing tracks
   - Apply BPM/swing
   - Recreate tracks from snapshot
   - Support bar_aligned flag for glitch-free loads

3. **Add Pattern File Operations to PyoEngine**
   - save_pattern(slot) with atomic writes
   - load_pattern(slot) with backup fallback
   - OSC handlers: /pattern/save, /pattern/load, /pattern/list

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

**Created:**

- `chronusctl.py` - Discovery and control tool
- `test_schema_audit.py` - Registry validation test
- `project/docs/pattern_saveload_research_2025-01-07.md` - Comprehensive research
- `project/handoffs/2025-01-07_sequencer_osc_integration_complete.md` - Previous work
- `patterns/` directory structure - Ready for patterns

**Modified:**

- `engine_pyo.py` - Added sequencer, registry, started pattern methods
- `pyo_modules/voice.py` - Added get_schema() method
- `CLAUDE.md` - Simplified to reference tools
- `.gitignore` - Added runtime file patterns

## 💡 Key Insights/Learnings

- Windows WASAPI incompatibility makes Pyo superior to SuperCollider for this project
- Self-maintaining registries prevent documentation drift
- Numbered slots (1-128) better than file browsers for live performance
- Atomic writes with temp files essential for pattern corruption prevention
- Bar-aligned loading prevents mid-pattern glitches

## 🔧 Technical Notes

Pattern save implementation plan:
- JSON format for Track dataclass serialization
- Atomic writes: temp → backup → replace
- 128 slots following hardware sequencer patterns
- Bar-aligned loading by default, immediate flag for testing
- Include full state: tracks, effects, voices, acid parameters

Critical state to capture:
- All Track dataclasses with patterns and notes
- Acid1 parameters (cutoff, res, env_amount, decay, drive, mix)
- Voice ADSR and filter settings
- Effects settings (reverb, delay)

## 📊 Progress Metrics

- Pattern Implementation: 15% (directory structure done)
- Tests Passing: Core functionality verified
- Context Window at Handoff: 93%
