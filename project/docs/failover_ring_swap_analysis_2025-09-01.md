# Failover Ring Swap Analysis - Critical Issue

**Date**: 2025-09-01  
**Author**: Chronus Nexus  
**For**: Senior Dev Review  
**Issue**: Post-failover command routing fix caused audio quality regression

## Executive Summary

We fixed post-failover command routing but introduced "engine noise" audio artifacts. The fix (swapping ring references during cleanup) breaks the worker-ring relationship, causing buffer synchronization issues identical to those we previously solved.

## Problem Timeline

### 1. Original Issue (Post-Failover Commands Not Working)
- **Symptom**: After failover, gate commands received but audio wouldn't stop
- **Root Cause**: Worker moved to different slot but kept reading from original ring
- **Example**: Standby worker becomes "primary" but still reads from standby_cmd_ring
- **Result**: Commands sent to primary_cmd_ring never reach active worker

### 2. Our Fix Attempt (Ring Swapping)
```python
# When primary fails, we now do:
self.primary_worker = self.standby_worker
self.primary_audio_ring = self.standby_audio_ring  # NEW: Swap rings too
self.primary_cmd_ring = self.standby_cmd_ring      # NEW: Swap rings too
```

### 3. New Problem (Engine Noise After Failover)  
- **Symptom**: Audio continues but degrades to engine/mosquito noise
- **Root Cause**: Worker has original ring reference, supervisor has swapped reference
- **Result**: Buffer synchronization lost, similar to original "tail = head" bug

## Technical Deep Dive

### How Workers Get Ring References

```python
def worker_process(worker_id, audio_ring, command_ring, ...):
    # Worker receives ring objects at spawn time
    # These are REFERENCES passed through multiprocessing
    # Worker uses these for its entire lifetime
```

When spawned:
```python
self.standby_worker = mp.Process(
    target=worker_process,
    args=(1, self.standby_audio_ring, self.standby_cmd_ring, ...)
)
```

### The Ring Swap Problem

**Before Cleanup:**
```
Supervisor References:          Worker Process Memory:
primary_audio_ring → Ring_A     Primary Worker → Ring_A  
standby_audio_ring → Ring_B     Standby Worker → Ring_B
active_idx = 0 (primary)        
```

**After Primary Fails & Cleanup (with our fix):**
```
Supervisor References:          Worker Process Memory:
primary_audio_ring → Ring_B     [Primary dead]
standby_audio_ring → Ring_C     Standby Worker → Ring_B (unchanged!)
active_idx = 1 (standby)        New Standby → Ring_C
```

**The Mismatch:**
- Supervisor thinks "primary_audio_ring" points to Ring_B
- Standby Worker (now primary) still writes to Ring_B 
- But it got Ring_B as "standby_audio_ring" originally
- This breaks assumptions about buffer state/synchronization

### Why This Causes Engine Noise

The engine noise pattern we fixed before was caused by:
1. **Buffer Skipping**: `tail = head` instead of sequential reading
2. **Timing Mismatch**: Producer/consumer rate misalignment
3. **State Confusion**: Reading from wrong position in ring

Our ring swap creates similar issues:
- Worker's internal state tied to original ring object
- Supervisor's view of rings doesn't match worker's view
- Possible cache effects or timing assumptions broken
- Sequential reading might be disrupted by reference confusion

## Proposed Solution

### Approach 1: Keep Rings Stable (Recommended)

**Principle**: Workers always write to their originally assigned rings. Only change which ring the audio callback reads from.

```python
def perform_post_switch_cleanup(self):
    if self.failed_side == 'primary':
        # Kill primary worker
        self.primary_worker.terminate()
        
        # Move standby worker to primary slot
        self.primary_worker = self.standby_worker
        self.standby_worker = None
        
        # DON'T swap rings - keep them with their slots
        # Just spawn new standby that will use standby rings
        
    # The audio callback already switched active_idx
    # Commands already broadcast to both rings
```

**Benefits:**
- Worker-ring relationship preserved
- No synchronization issues
- Commands work via broadcasting
- Audio quality maintained

**Drawback:**
- Slightly confusing that "primary_worker" uses "standby_audio_ring"
- But this is just naming - the system works correctly

### Approach 2: Track Ring Ownership Explicitly

**Principle**: Maintain a mapping of which worker owns which ring.

```python
self.worker_rings = {
    worker_id: (audio_ring, cmd_ring, event)
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear ownership model
- Can route commands precisely
- Flexible for future features

**Drawback:**
- More complex
- Requires refactoring

### Approach 3: Restart Workers with Correct Rings

**Principle**: After failover, restart the promoted worker with new rings.

**Benefits:**
- Clean state
- Matches intuition

**Drawback:**
- Causes audio interruption
- Defeats purpose of fast failover

## Recommendation

**Use Approach 1**: Keep rings tied to slots, not workers. This is the simplest fix that preserves both audio quality and command routing.

The key insight: **The rings are infrastructure tied to positions (primary/standby), not to specific worker processes.** Workers move between positions but rings stay put.

## Implementation Notes

1. Revert the ring swapping code
2. Keep command broadcasting (already working)  
3. Document that workers may use "misnamed" rings after failover
4. Consider renaming variables for clarity:
   - `slot0_audio_ring` instead of `primary_audio_ring`
   - `slot1_audio_ring` instead of `standby_audio_ring`

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Basic audio works
- [ ] Commands work before failover
- [ ] Failover maintains audio quality
- [ ] Commands work after failover
- [ ] Multiple failovers work correctly
- [ ] No engine noise at any point

## Questions for Senior Dev

1. Is our analysis of the ring reference issue correct?
2. Do you agree that keeping rings tied to slots is the right approach?
3. Should we rename variables to avoid confusion about "primary worker using standby ring"?
4. Any other architectural considerations we're missing?
