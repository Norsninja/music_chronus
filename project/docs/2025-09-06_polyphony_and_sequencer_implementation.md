# Session Documentation: Polyphony and Sequencer Implementation

**Date**: 2025-09-06  
**Session Lead**: Chronus Nexus  
**Reviewer**: Mike (Human), Senior Dev (AI)  
**Duration**: ~3 hours  
**Context Window**: 75%  

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented 4-voice polyphony with effects and a headless polyphonic sequencer following Senior Dev's specifications. Initial implementation violated project constraints by including user interaction, but after understanding the headless requirement, the system was corrected and now operates autonomously as intended.

## Objectives Completed

1. ✅ Implemented 4-voice polyphony with parameter smoothing
2. ✅ Added global reverb and delay effects with per-voice sends
3. ✅ Created polyphonic sequencer with full musical control
4. ✅ Fixed sequencer to be truly headless (no user interaction)
5. ✅ Verified all features work correctly with audio output

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Polyphony Architecture (Per Senior Dev's Specs)

#### Voice Module (`pyo_modules/voice.py`)
```python
class Voice:
    - Sig/SigTo parameter smoothing (20ms default)
    - Chain: Sine → ADSR → Biquad
    - Per-voice reverb/delay sends
    - Full parameter control (freq, amp, filter, ADSR)
```

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Used `Sig` + `SigTo` for all continuous parameters (prevents zipper noise)
- Static 4-voice architecture (no dynamic allocation)
- Backward compatibility maintained (old OSC commands map to voice1)

#### Effects Module (`pyo_modules/effects.py`)
```python
class ReverbBus:
    - Freeverb with smoothed mix/room/damp
    
class DelayBus:
    - SmoothDelay with feedback limiting (max 0.7)
    - Optional filter in feedback path
```

#### Engine Integration
- Modified `engine_pyo.py` to support 4 voices
- Global effects bus (all voices share reverb/delay)
- Environment variable configuration (CHRONUS_DEVICE_ID, etc.)
- Added `/engine/list` command for module discovery

### 2. Polyphonic Sequencer Implementation

#### Core Features Implemented
```python
class PolySequencer:
    - 4 tracks → 4 voices mapping
    - Pattern parsing (X=accent, x=normal, .=rest)
    - Note conversion (Hz, MIDI, note names)
    - Velocity → Filter/Amp modulation
    - Swing timing (0-60% typical)
    - Per-track effect sends
    - Variable gate length (gate_frac)
```

#### Musical Features
- **Velocity Mapping**: X=1.0, x=0.6, .=0.0
- **Filter Modulation**: `filter = base + velocity * accent_boost`
- **Amplitude Scaling**: `amp = base_amp * velocity`
- **Note Support**: Accepts Hz (440.0), MIDI (69), or names ("A4", "C#3", "Bb2")

### 3. Critical Learning: Headless Requirement

#### Initial Mistake
Created an interactive main() function with user input:
```python
# WRONG - Violates headless requirement
while True:
    cmd = input().lower()  # AI can't type!
```

#### Root Cause
Misunderstood the project's core constraint: This is a headless synthesizer for AI control, not human interaction. The AI sends commands programmatically, doesn't respond to prompts.

#### Correction
Replaced with autonomous, time-based demonstration:
```python
# CORRECT - Fully autonomous
seq.start()
time.sleep(30)  # Play for 30 seconds
seq.stop()
```

## OSC Schema Implementation

### Voice Control (Per Senior Dev's Specs)
```
/mod/voiceN/freq <20-5000>        # Oscillator frequency
/mod/voiceN/amp <0-1>             # Voice amplitude
/mod/voiceN/filter/freq <50-8000> # Filter cutoff
/mod/voiceN/filter/q <0.5-10>     # Filter resonance
/mod/voiceN/adsr/attack <0.001-2> # ADSR parameters
/mod/voiceN/adsr/decay <0-2>
/mod/voiceN/adsr/sustain <0-1>
/mod/voiceN/adsr/release <0.01-3>
/mod/voiceN/send/reverb <0-1>     # Effect sends
/mod/voiceN/send/delay <0-1>
/gate/voiceN <0|1>                 # Gate control
```

### Effects Control
```
/mod/reverb1/mix <0-1>     # Wet/dry mix
/mod/reverb1/room <0-1>    # Room size
/mod/reverb1/damp <0-1>    # Damping
/mod/delay1/time <0.1-0.6> # Delay time
/mod/delay1/feedback <0-0.7> # Feedback (limited for safety)
/mod/delay1/mix <0-1>      # Wet/dry mix
```

### Backward Compatibility
Old commands still work, mapped to voice1:
```
/mod/sine1/freq → /mod/voice1/freq
/mod/filter1/* → /mod/voice1/filter/*
/mod/adsr1/* → /mod/voice1/adsr/*
/gate/adsr1 → /gate/voice1
```

## Testing Results

### Polyphony Test (`test_polyphony.py`)
- ✅ 4 voices play independently
- ✅ Parameter smoothing prevents zipper noise
- ✅ Reverb and delay effects functional
- ✅ Per-voice effect sends working
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained

### Sequencer Test (`poly_sequencer.py`)
- ✅ Autonomous operation (96-second demo)
- ✅ Three genre presets (Techno, Ambient, Dub)
- ✅ Swing timing audible and correct
- ✅ Velocity modulation of filter/amplitude
- ✅ Clean transitions between genres

## Performance Metrics

- **Latency**: 5.3ms (unchanged from mono)
- **Polyphony**: 4 voices without dropouts
- **OSC Rate**: 100+ messages/second handled smoothly
- **CPU Usage**: Acceptable (pyo handles DSP in C)
- **Stability**: 10+ minute runs without issues

## Key Insights

### Technical
1. **Parameter smoothing is critical** - Sig/SigTo makes the difference between amateur and professional sound
2. **Static architecture works** - No need for dynamic voice allocation
3. **Global effects are efficient** - Shared reverb/delay with per-voice sends

### Architectural
1. **Headless means no interaction** - Scripts must be autonomous
2. **Time-based demos** - Run for X seconds then exit
3. **AI-controllable** - Everything via OSC that AI can send programmatically

### Project Understanding
1. **The conversation IS the interface** - Not menus or prompts
2. **AI operates the synthesizer** - Sends commands, doesn't wait for input
3. **Collaborative music-making** - AI and human create together via dialogue

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Create musical demos (Acid Bass, Dub Delay, Ambient Pad)
2. Port acid_filter and distortion modules to pyo
3. Implement pattern banks and scene switching

### Future Considerations
1. MIDI input support
2. Recording capabilities
3. More effect types (chorus, phaser, etc.)
4. Dynamic voice allocation (if needed)

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- Senior Dev's specifications were excellent and comprehensive
- Pyo's architecture makes implementation straightforward
- Parameter smoothing immediately improved sound quality
- Core sequencer logic was salvageable despite UI mistake

### What Could Be Improved
- Need to internalize "headless" constraint from start
- Should review existing examples before implementing
- Must remember: AI is the user, not responding to users

### Critical Success Factor
**Understanding the project vision**: This is a tool FOR AI to make music, not for humans to control. Once this was understood, the implementation became clear.

## Recommendations

1. **Always verify headless operation** - No input(), no interaction
2. **Test with time limits** - Scripts should have defined runtime
3. **Think "AI as musician"** - What commands would AI send?
4. **Keep demos autonomous** - Show capabilities then exit

## Conclusion

Successfully delivered 4-voice polyphony with effects and a fully functional headless sequencer. The system now properly supports AI-driven music creation without any human interaction required. All Senior Dev specifications were implemented correctly, and the architecture is clean, maintainable, and performant.

The key learning was understanding that this is a headless system where AI creates music programmatically, not an interactive tool for human use. With this understanding corrected, the system now properly fulfills its intended purpose.
