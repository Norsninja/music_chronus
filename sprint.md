- [x] Full OSC schema with backward compatibility

#### Sequencer Updates ‚úÖ
- [x] PolySequencer with swing and note conversion
- [x] Headless operation (removed all user interaction)
- [x] Genre presets (Techno, Ambient, Dub)
- [x] Velocity ‚Üí Filter/Amp modulation

### Medium-term Goals (Next Month)

#### 4. Live Performance
- [ ] MIDI input support
- [ ] Parameter automation
- [ ] Scene transitions
- [ ] Recording capabilities
- [ ] Live looping

#### 5. Musical Knowledge
- [ ] Chord progressions
- [ ] Scale awareness
- [ ] Genre templates
- [ ] Sound design presets

## Success Metrics

### Technical ‚úÖ (Already Achieved)
- ‚úÖ <10ms latency (5.3ms)
- ‚úÖ Zero dropouts
- ‚úÖ Clean architecture
- ‚úÖ OSC control working

### Musical üéØ (New Focus)
- [ ] Create 5 different musical styles
- [ ] 10-minute live performance without issues
- [ ] AI can improvise musically
- [ ] Patterns feel "groovy" not mechanical
- [ ] Can create emotional progression

## Development Philosophy

**Before**: How do we make Python do real-time audio?
**Now**: How do we make interesting music together?

The technical foundation is solved. Every session now should produce music, not debug code.

## Session Protocol

1. **Start with sound** - Boot engine, make noise immediately
2. **Musical goal** - "Let's make a techno beat" not "Let's test buffers"
3. **Iterate on music** - Change patterns, add effects, explore
4. **Save what sounds good** - Build a library of patterns/presets
5. **Document musical discoveries** - What combinations work?

## Current Sprint Tasks

### Today (2025-09-06)
- [x] Implement 4-voice polyphony with effects
- [x] Fix critical effects routing bug
- [x] Make sequencer headless
- [x] Port acid_filter to pyo (Complete - MoogLP working)
- [ ] Implement authentic 303 slide/portamento
- [ ] Upgrade oscillators to band-limited waveforms
- [ ] Fix acid input routing (pre-filter tap)

### Next Session
- [ ] Create Acid Bass demo with new modules
- [ ] Create Dub Delay demo  
- [ ] Create Ambient Pad demo
- [ ] 10-minute stability test

## Key Insights

1. **Tools matter** - Right tool (pyo) made everything simple
2. **Music first** - Technical perfection without music is worthless
3. **Collaboration focus** - AI+Human making music, not AI running code
4. **Simplicity wins** - 500 lines that work > 5000 that don't

## Next Session Focus

**Make music, not infrastructure.**

Start the engine, create a beat, add a bassline, apply effects. If we're not making sound in the first 5 minutes, we're doing it wrong.
