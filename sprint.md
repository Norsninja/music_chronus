# Sprint: Musical Exploration with Pyo

## Current State: Foundation Complete âœ…

After 45+ sessions, we've reached clarity:
- **Problem solved**: Use pyo's C engine for DSP (not Python)
- **Architecture simplified**: 500 lines instead of 5000
- **Performance achieved**: 5.3ms latency, zero clicks
- **Focus restored**: Music creation, not infrastructure

## What We Have Now

### Working Components
- âœ… **engine_pyo.py** - Headless synthesizer with OSC control
- âœ… **Pattern sequencer** - Our `X.x.` notation works perfectly
- âœ… **OSC schema** - `/mod/<id>/<param>`, `/gate/<id>`
- âœ… **Examples** - Test scripts showing everything works

### Preserved Knowledge
- **project/** - Full documentation of our journey
- **CLAUDE.md** - AI identity and collaboration model
- **AGENTS.md** - Team structure
- **DSP modules** - acid_filter.py, distortion.py (to port)

## Next Phase: Musical Creation ðŸŽµ

### Immediate Goals (This Session - 2025-09-06)

#### 1. Authentic 303 Implementation (Based on Senior Dev Review)
- [x] Acid filter ported to pyo with MoogLP (working but needs refinement)
- [ ] **Priority 1: Slide/Portamento** - Port with numeric time updates, legato behavior
- [ ] **Priority 2: Band-limited Oscillators** - Osc with SawTable/SquareTable 
- [ ] **Priority 3: Pre-filter Tap** - Feed acid from raw oscillator signal
- [ ] **Priority 4: Brighter Defaults** - Cutoff 1500Hz, env_amount 2500Hz
- [ ] **Priority 5: Sequencer Slide Pattern** - Support "-" for tied notes

#### 2. Technical Corrections (Critical)
- [ ] Fix Port parameter types (numeric only, not Sig/SigTo)
- [ ] Implement selective slide (only on tied notes, not all frequency changes)
- [ ] Add get_prefilter_signal() to Voice class
- [ ] Update engine routing to use pre-filter signal for acid

### Completed (2025-09-06)

#### Polyphony Implementation âœ…
- [x] 4-voice architecture with Sig/SigTo smoothing
- [x] Global reverb/delay with per-voice sends
- [x] Fixed critical effects routing bug (pass Mix at init)
- [x] Full OSC schema with backward compatibility

#### Sequencer Updates âœ…
- [x] PolySequencer with swing and note conversion
- [x] Headless operation (removed all user interaction)
- [x] Genre presets (Techno, Ambient, Dub)
- [x] Velocity â†’ Filter/Amp modulation

### Medium-term Goals (Next Month)

#### 4. Live Performance
- [ ] MIDI input support
- [ ] Parameter automation
- [ ] Scene transitions
- [ ] Recording capabilities
- [ ] Live looping

#### 5. Musical Knowledge
- [ ] Chord progressions
- [ ] Scale awareness
- [ ] Genre templates
- [ ] Sound design presets

## Success Metrics

### Technical âœ… (Already Achieved)
- âœ… <10ms latency (5.3ms)
- âœ… Zero dropouts
- âœ… Clean architecture
- âœ… OSC control working

### Musical ðŸŽ¯ (New Focus)
- [ ] Create 5 different musical styles
- [ ] 10-minute live performance without issues
- [ ] AI can improvise musically
- [ ] Patterns feel "groovy" not mechanical
- [ ] Can create emotional progression

## Development Philosophy

**Before**: How do we make Python do real-time audio?
**Now**: How do we make interesting music together?

The technical foundation is solved. Every session now should produce music, not debug code.

## Session Protocol

1. **Start with sound** - Boot engine, make noise immediately
2. **Musical goal** - "Let's make a techno beat" not "Let's test buffers"
3. **Iterate on music** - Change patterns, add effects, explore
4. **Save what sounds good** - Build a library of patterns/presets
5. **Document musical discoveries** - What combinations work?

## Current Sprint Tasks

### Today (2025-09-06)
- [x] Implement 4-voice polyphony with effects
- [x] Fix critical effects routing bug
- [x] Make sequencer headless
- [x] Port acid_filter to pyo (Complete - MoogLP working)
- [ ] Implement authentic 303 slide/portamento
- [ ] Upgrade oscillators to band-limited waveforms
- [ ] Fix acid input routing (pre-filter tap)

### Next Session
- [ ] Create Acid Bass demo with new modules
- [ ] Create Dub Delay demo  
- [ ] Create Ambient Pad demo
- [ ] 10-minute stability test

## Key Insights

1. **Tools matter** - Right tool (pyo) made everything simple
2. **Music first** - Technical perfection without music is worthless
3. **Collaboration focus** - AI+Human making music, not AI running code
4. **Simplicity wins** - 500 lines that work > 5000 that don't

## Next Session Focus

**Make music, not infrastructure.**

Start the engine, create a beat, add a bassline, apply effects. If we're not making sound in the first 5 minutes, we're doing it wrong.
