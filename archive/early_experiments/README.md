# Early Python Music Experiments

Initial attempts at creating music with Python before developing the full architecture.

## Evolution
- music_lab.py, live_music.py - First attempts at audio generation
- test_sound.py - Basic sound output tests
- test_audio*.py - Early audio engine tests
- test_60s_stability.py - Stability testing (superseded by supervisor tests)
- heartbeat.wav - Test audio file

These experiments led to the development of our Phase 1 audio engine and supervisor.
