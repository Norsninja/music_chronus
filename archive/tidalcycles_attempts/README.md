# TidalCycles/SuperCollider Attempts

These files represent our initial attempt to use TidalCycles and SuperCollider for the AI-Human music collaboration project.

## Why Archived
We discovered that TidalCycles/SuperCollider created too many layers of abstraction for direct AI control. We pivoted to building our own Python-based modular synthesizer for more direct control.
