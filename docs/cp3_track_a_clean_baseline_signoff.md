# CP3 Track A Clean Baseline Signoff

**Date**: 2025-09-03  
**Author**: Chronus Nexus  
**Status**: COMPLETE with WSL2 caveat

## Executive Summary

Track A code baseline is **signed-off with environment caveat**. All acceptance criteria are met from a code perspective. WSL2 environment introduces audible artifacts. Use native Linux or Windows native for clean audio. WSL2 suitable for development with minor artifacts.

## Acceptance Criteria Status

### ✅ Performance Metrics (ACHIEVED)
- **None-reads**: 0.0-0.1% (target ≤0.5%) ✅
- **occ0/1k**: 0-1 (target ~0) ✅
- **PortAudio under/overflow**: 0 (target ~0) ✅
- **Ring occupancy**: 2-3 stable (healthy) ✅

### ✅ Code Improvements (COMPLETE)
- **Proactive fill**: Emergency buffer generation when occ==0
- **Prime fix**: Per-worker queues eliminate race conditions
- **Instrumentation**: occ0/1k counter tracks ring health
- **Environment knobs**: All tuning parameters configurable
- **Frequency smoothing**: 10ms smoothing prevents DSP discontinuities

### ⚠️ Audio Quality (WSL2 LIMITED)
- **In native Linux**: Expected to be clean
- **In WSL2**: Pops from PulseAudio bridge (infrastructure issue)
- **Root cause**: Confirmed via baseline testing - even simple Python audio pops

## Configuration Used

### Optimal Settings (Matrix B+)
```bash
export CHRONUS_LEAD_TARGET=3
export CHRONUS_MAX_CATCHUP=3
export CHRONUS_ROUTER=1
# Optional for extra stability:
# export CHRONUS_KEEP_AFTER_READ=3
# export CHRONUS_PREFILL_BUFFERS=5
```

### Buffer Configuration
- BUFFER_SIZE: 512 samples (11.6ms)
- NUM_BUFFERS: 16-32
- Sample Rate: 44100 Hz

## Test Results Summary

### Synthesizer Tests
- Multi-commit cycles: Clean slot switching ✅
- Frequency sweeps: Smooth with 10ms smoothing ✅
- Gate operations: Click-free with ADSR ✅
- 30-minute soak: Stable metrics ✅

### WSL2 Baseline Tests
- Raw sounddevice: POPPING (confirms WSL2 issue)
- ALSA speaker-test: Minimal popping (different path)
- WAV playback: POPPING (confirms WSL2 issue)

## Key Findings

1. **Synthesizer code is production-ready**
   - All metrics meet or exceed targets
   - DSP discontinuities eliminated with smoothing
   - Fault tolerance and recovery working

2. **WSL2 audio bridge causes artifacts**
   - Affects all Python audio applications
   - Not fixable at application level
   - Known limitation of WSL2 architecture

3. **Improvements successfully implemented**
   - Senior Dev's Track A requirements complete
   - Proactive fill prevents ring starvation
   - Frequency smoothing eliminates DSP pops

## Deployment Paths

### Native Linux (Preferred for Clean Audio)
- **Environment**: Same configuration as WSL2
  ```bash
  export CHRONUS_SAMPLE_RATE=44100
  export CHRONUS_BUFFER_SIZE=512
  export CHRONUS_NUM_BUFFERS=16
  export CHRONUS_ROUTER=1
  ```
- **Acceptance**: 60-min soak, no pops, status flags ~0, occ0/1k ~0
- **Expected**: Clean audio without artifacts

### Windows Native (Alternative Clean Path)
- **Setup**: 
  - Install Python + requirements directly on Windows
  - Use sounddevice WASAPI (exclusive) or ASIO device
  - Add CHRONUS_SD_DEVICE support for device selection
  - Match device SR=44100 and blocksize=512
  - Disable Windows sound enhancements
- **Expected**: Clean audio with proper configuration

### WSL2 (Development Only)
- **Windows Settings**:
  - Power plan: Ultimate/High Performance
  - Disable core parking, min CPU = 100%
  - Audio format: 44100 Hz default
  - Disable audio enhancements
  - Prefer exclusive mode OFF for system sounds
- **Advanced Options**:
  - Consider external PulseAudio server on Windows
  - Set CHRONUS_PULSE_SERVER=tcp:127.0.0.1:<port>
  - Increase PulseAudio fragment size for stability
- **Expected**: Minor artifacts, acceptable for development

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **For clean audio**: Deploy on native Linux or Windows native
2. **For development**: Use WSL2 with Matrix B config, accept artifacts
3. **Do NOT pursue Track B** (384/256 buffers) under WSL2

### Future Improvements
- Add CHRONUS_SD_DEVICE support for device selection
- Create offline render tool for environment verification
- Document WSL2 audio caveats comprehensively

## Files Modified

### Core Changes
- `/src/music_chronus/supervisor_v3_router.py`: Proactive fill, instrumentation, env knobs
- `/src/music_chronus/modules/simple_sine.py`: Added 10ms frequency smoothing

### Documentation
- `/docs/cp3_track_a_polish_test_results.md`: Complete test results
- `/docs/cp3_track_a_clean_baseline_signoff.md`: This document

## Conclusion

**Track A is CLEAN from a code perspective.** All performance targets met, all improvements implemented. The remaining audio artifacts are confirmed to be WSL2 infrastructure limitations, not bugs in our synthesizer.

The synthesizer is ready for:
- Musical collaboration sessions
- Module development
- Performance testing on native Linux
