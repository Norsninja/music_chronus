# Audio De-clicking Fixes Implemented

**Date**: 2025-09-05  
**Implemented by**: Chronus Nexus  
**Based on**: Senior Dev's reconciled recommendations

## Summary

Implemented allocation-free, low-risk de-clicking fixes following Senior Dev's production-focused approach. Key principle: maintain signal continuity rather than forcing resets.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. ADSR De-clicking ✅

**File**: `modules/adsr.py`

**Changes**:
- Enforced minimum attack time: 3ms (prevents instant 0→1 jumps)
- Enforced minimum release time: 10ms (prevents instant 1→0 drops)
- Gate-on now starts from CURRENT level (maintains continuity)
- Added epsilon clamp when near zero (prevents zero-edge discontinuity)
- Increased default attack to 20ms, release to 80ms

**Rationale**: Starting attack from current level prevents clicks on retrigger. Minimum times ensure no instant changes.

### 2. BaseModule Per-Sample Ramp Infrastructure ✅

**File**: `modules/base.py`

**Changes**:
- Pre-allocated ramp_buffer in __init__ (allocation-free)
- Added threshold detection for large parameter changes
- Gain changes >20% trigger per-sample ramp
- Frequency changes >100Hz trigger per-sample ramp
- Ramp values pre-computed using existing buffer

**Rationale**: Only applies expensive per-sample ramping when needed (large deltas), keeping hot path simple for normal operation.

### 3. SimpleSine Frequency Smoothing ✅

**File**: `modules/simple_sine.py`

**Changes**:
- Track last frequency to detect jumps
- Frequency jumps >50Hz trigger per-sample phase increment ramping
- Linear interpolation of phase increment across buffer
- Maintains phase continuity throughout

**Rationale**: Large frequency jumps are smoothed sample-by-sample, preventing phase discontinuities while keeping normal operation fast.

## What We Did NOT Do

Following Senior Dev's advice, we avoided:

1. **Hard reset to 0 in ADSR**: Would create clicks when retriggering from non-zero
2. **Soft-clip in audio callback**: Adds non-linearity, masks issues, changes tone
3. **Always-on per-sample processing**: Keeps hot path fast for normal params
4. **DC blocker**: Not needed yet, would add latency

## Testing Recommendations

### A/B Test Scenarios

1. **Clean baseline**:
   - Set ADSR attack=20ms, release=80ms
   - Fixed gain and cutoff (no changes)
   - Expected: No pops

2. **Gate transitions**:
   - Rapid gate on/off with new ADSR
   - Expected: Significant reduction in pops

3. **Frequency sweeps**:
   - Jump from 220Hz to 880Hz
   - Expected: Smooth transition, no clicks

4. **Parameter automation**:
   - Sweep filter cutoff from 200Hz to 2000Hz
   - Expected: Smooth with existing 25ms smoothing

## Validation Steps

1. **Before/After Recording**:
   ```bash
   # Record before fixes (using old modules)
   python supervisor_windows.py  # Press 'r' for 10s recording
   
   # Record after fixes (using updated modules)  
   python supervisor_windows.py  # Press 'r' for 10s recording
   ```

2. **Check for allocations**:
   - Verify no allocations in hot path
   - Ramp buffer is pre-allocated
   - No new arrays created during processing

3. **Performance check**:
   - Callback timing should remain <0.5ms mean
   - No increase in CPU usage

## Next Steps

1. **Mike**: Test with your ears on Windows, note any remaining pops
2. **Senior Dev**: Review diffs for RT-safety confirmation
3. **Optional future**: Add micro-fade for first/last 2-5ms of ADSR if needed

## Code Safety

All changes are:
- ✅ Allocation-free (pre-allocated buffers)
- ✅ RT-safe (no blocking operations)
- ✅ Backwards compatible (same API)
- ✅ Opt-in (only activate on large changes)
