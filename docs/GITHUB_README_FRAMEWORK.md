## README.md Structure (Draft)

### Header Section
- Project title and tagline
- Build status badges (future)
- Key performance metrics (6ms latency, etc.)

### Vision Section (To Be Filled From Interview)
- What problem this solves
- Why existing solutions don't work
- The collaborative approach

### Quick Demo Section
```bash
# What the end result looks like
> load oscillator
> load filter
> patch oscillator > filter > output
> set oscillator.freq 440
> set filter.cutoff 1000
# Music plays!
```

## Content Placeholders for Interview

The following sections need your direct input to capture your vision accurately:

### Project Vision Questions
1. **Problem Statement**: In your words, what problem does this project solve?
2. **Motivation**: Why did you start this project? What wasn't working with existing tools?
3. **Unique Value**: What makes this different from TidalCycles, SuperCollider, Pure Data?
4. **Collaboration Aspect**: How do you envision working with AI in music creation?
5. **Target Users**: Who do you think would be interested in this?

### Goals and Scope Questions  
1. **Primary Goal**: What's the main thing you want to achieve?
2. **Success Metrics**: How will you know this project succeeded?
3. **Scope Boundaries**: What is this project NOT trying to do?
4. **Long-term Vision**: Where do you see this in 2-3 years?

### Technical Philosophy Questions
1. **Architecture Choices**: Why Python? Why CLI? Why modular?
2. **Performance Requirements**: Why is low latency important to you?
3. **Testing Approach**: Why did you choose test-first development?
4. **Module System**: Why did you want hot-reloadable modules?

### Personal Motivation Questions
1. **Musical Background**: Tell me about your experience with music/DJing
2. **Technical Background**: How do you approach learning new technologies?
3. **Collaboration Style**: How do you like to work with AI?
4. **Creative Process**: How do you envision using this for music?

## Documentation Tone and Style Guidelines

Based on our collaboration, the documentation should:
- Be direct and honest about technical challenges
- Emphasize the collaborative/iterative approach
- Include concrete performance numbers
- Acknowledge what works and what doesn't
- Focus on practical utility over theoretical benefits
- Use your voice/perspective, not generic marketing language

## Next Steps

1. Conduct interview to capture your vision accurately
2. Write initial README.md with your responses
3. Create technical documentation from test results
4. Organize all research and findings
5. Prepare repository for eventual GitHub publication
