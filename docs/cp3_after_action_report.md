# CP3 Router Integration - After Action Report

**Date**: 2025-01-02  
**Session**: Phase 3 Router Integration Debugging  
**Contributors**: Chronus Nexus, Mike (Human), Senior Dev (Advisor)

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented and debugged the CP3 router integration, achieving full patch building and DAG-based signal routing. The system can now dynamically create, connect, and activate synthesizer patches via OSC. However, audio output is not yet functional despite correct patch construction.

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Fixed Critical API Mismatches
**Files Modified**: `src/music_chronus/supervisor_v3_router.py`

- **Line 113**: Changed `command_ring.is_empty()` → `command_ring.has_data()`
- **Line 345**: Changed `audio_ring.read()` → `audio_ring.read_latest()`
- **Lines 146-150**: Added `last_good` buffer with `np.copyto()` for zero-allocation audio callback
- **Lines 189-191**: Added `target_idx` for buffer-boundary switching

### 2. Fixed Indentation Issues in Worker Process
**Location**: `src/music_chronus/supervisor_v3_router.py` lines 112-178

**Problem**: Patch queue processing had incorrect indentation causing commands to be processed outside the empty check.

**Fix**: Properly indented the entire try-except block inside `if not patch_queue.empty()`

### 3. Fixed Module Registry Access
**Location**: `src/music_chronus/supervisor_v3_router.py` lines 84-92, 129-130

**Problem**: Treated ModuleRegistry object as dict when accessing modules

**Fix**: 
- Added `registered_modules = registry._modules` to access the class variable
- Changed lookup from `if module_type in registry` to `if module_type in registered_modules`
- Changed instantiation from `registry[module_type]` to `registered_modules[module_type]`

### 4. Fixed Method Name Mismatch
**Location**: `src/music_chronus/supervisor_v3_router.py` line 152

**Problem**: Called non-existent `router.build_execution_order()`

**Fix**: Changed to correct method `router.get_processing_order()`

### 5. Added Module Registration to Router
**Location**: `src/music_chronus/supervisor_v3_router.py` lines 131-133

**Problem**: Modules were added to ModuleHost but not to PatchRouter's graph

**Fix**: Added `router.add_module(module_id, module)` when creating modules

### 6. Environment Variable Alignment
**Location**: `src/music_chronus/supervisor_v3_router.py`
- Lines 403-404: Changed to use `CHRONUS_OSC_HOST/PORT`
- Lines 537-540: Added `CHRONUS_PULSE_SERVER` → `PULSE_SERVER` mapping

### 7. Module Registration Decorators
**Files Modified**:
- `src/music_chronus/modules/simple_sine.py`
- `src/music_chronus/modules/adsr.py`
- `src/music_chronus/modules/biquad_filter.py`

**Added**: `@register_module('module_name')` decorators to each module class

### 8. Registry BaseModule Compatibility
**File Modified**: `src/music_chronus/module_registry.py`

**Changes**:
- Lines 39-42: Added import for BaseModule with fallback
- Lines 86-94: Modified validation to accept both BaseModule and BaseModuleV2
- Lines 96-107: Made RT-safety validation optional for BaseModule classes

## Current System Behavior

### What's Working ✅
1. **Patch Building**: Modules created successfully via OSC `/patch/create`
2. **DAG Construction**: Connections established with `/patch/connect`
3. **Patch Commit**: Execution order calculated correctly (`['osc1', 'env1', 'filter1']`)
4. **Slot Switching**: Failover from slot 0 to slot 1 works (Failovers: 1)
5. **Audio Pipeline**: No dropouts (0.00% None reads)
6. **OSC Reception**: Parameter commands received (`/mod/osc1/frequency = 440.0`)

### What's Not Working ❌
1. **No Audio Output**: Despite correct patch, no sound is produced
2. **Gate Commands Not Processed**: `/gate/env1` received but not triggering audio
3. **Parameter Application**: Commands queued but may not reach active modules

## Hypothesis for Audio Issue

### Primary Theory: Command Ring Processing Gap
The OSC handlers show messages are received and written to command rings, but the active worker (slot 1 with router) may not be processing them correctly during audio generation.

**Evidence**:
- OSC shows `/mod/osc1/frequency = 440.0` received
- Command is written to both slot0 and slot1 command rings
- But no corresponding worker processing messages
- No gate trigger confirmation

### Secondary Theory: Router Audio Path Issue
The ModuleHost in router mode (`_process_router_chain`) may not be producing non-zero audio buffers.

**Potential Issues**:
1. Modules not marked as `active` after creation
2. Work buffers not properly initialized
3. Edge buffers not connecting module outputs
4. Final output buffer not reaching audio callback

### Tertiary Theory: Module State Issue
The dynamically created modules may not be in a sound-producing state.

**Potential Issues**:
1. SimpleSine phase accumulator not advancing
2. ADSR envelope stuck at zero (no gate received)
3. Filter in bypass or muted state

    └── biquad_filter.py      # Added @register_module
```

## Next Steps for Investigation

1. **Verify Command Processing in Active Worker**
   - Add debug output when worker processes commands from command_ring
   - Confirm module_host.queue_command() is called
   - Check if module_host.process_commands() applies parameters

2. **Trace Audio Buffer Flow**
   - Add debug to show buffer values at each stage
   - Verify SimpleSine produces non-zero output
   - Check ADSR envelope state transitions
   - Confirm final buffer reaches audio callback

3. **Validate Module States**
   - Check `module.active` flag after creation
   - Verify parameter application (freq, gain, gate)
   - Test modules in isolation before routing

4. **Test Linear Chain Mode**
   - Temporarily disable router mode
   - Verify basic audio works without router
   - Compare behavior between modes

## Test Sequence That Reproduces Issue

```python
# 1. Create modules
/patch/create osc1 simple_sine
/patch/create env1 adsr
/patch/create filter1 biquad_filter

# 2. Connect modules
/patch/connect osc1 env1
/patch/connect env1 filter1

# 3. Commit patch (triggers slot switch)
/patch/commit

# 4. Send parameters (received but no audio)
/mod/osc1/frequency 440.0
/gate/env1 1
/gate/env1 0
```

## Conclusion

The CP3 router integration is architecturally complete and functionally correct for patch building and management. The remaining issue is audio generation, likely due to a disconnect between the command processing and the audio generation loop in the worker with router support. The next session should focus on tracing the audio buffer values and command application to identify where the signal chain breaks.
