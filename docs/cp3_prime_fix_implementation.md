# CP3 Prime Fix Implementation

**Date**: 2025-09-03  
**Author**: Chronus Nexus  
**Status**: Fix implemented per Senior Dev's specifications

## Problem Summary

The patch queue was shared between all workers, causing race conditions where the active worker would consume patch commands meant for the standby worker. This caused prime_ready to be set on the wrong slot, leading to timeouts and no audio switching.

## Senior Dev's Solution

Switch to per-worker patch queues and route commands explicitly to the standby worker only.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Changed from single queue to per-worker queues (line 420)
```python
# Before:
self.patch_queue = mp.Queue(maxsize=100) if USE_ROUTER else None

# After:
self.patch_queues = [mp.Queue(maxsize=100), mp.Queue(maxsize=100)] if USE_ROUTER else [None, None]
```

### 2. Pass specific queue to each worker (line 478)
```python
# Before:
patch_queue = self.patch_queue if is_standby else None

# After:
patch_queue = self.patch_queues[slot_idx] if (USE_ROUTER and is_standby) else None
```

### 3. Route all patch commands to standby only

In all handlers (`handle_patch_create`, `handle_patch_connect`, `handle_patch_commit`, `handle_patch_abort`):
```python
# Before:
if self.patch_queue:
    self.patch_queue.put({...})

# After:
if USE_ROUTER:
    standby_idx = 1 - self.active_idx.value
    print(f"[OSC] Routing patch ... to standby slot {standby_idx}")
    self.patch_queues[standby_idx].put({...})
```

### 4. Added diagnostic logging

- Worker: `print(f"[WORKER {slot_id}] prime_ready set")` when setting flag
- Supervisor: Shows which slot it's waiting for and current prime flags
- OSC handlers: Show routing to specific standby slot

## Files Modified

- `/src/music_chronus/supervisor_v3_router.py`:
  - Lines 420: Queue initialization
  - Lines 478: Queue assignment
  - Lines 519-522: Create handler
  - Lines 538-542: Connect handler  
  - Lines 556: Commit handler
  - Lines 587-591: Prime handler
  - Lines 624: Abort handler
  - Line 256: Worker prime logging
  - Lines 608-610: Supervisor wait logging

## Testing

Run `python test_prime_fix.py` to verify:
1. Patch commands route to correct standby slot
2. Prime completes without timeout
3. Audio switches properly between slots
4. No popping/artifacts

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Patch commands route only to standby worker
- [x] Correct worker processes patch (logs show matching slot IDs)
- [x] Prime completes without timeout
- [x] Slots alternate correctly on commits
- [x] Clean audio without popping
- [ ] Multi-commit stress test passes
- [ ] Soak test shows stable occupancy

## Next Steps

1. Test with supervisor restart
2. Run `python test_multi_commit.py`
3. Run soak test for 10+ minutes
4. Verify none-reads stay <0.5%
