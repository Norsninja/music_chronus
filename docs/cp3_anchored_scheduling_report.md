# CP3 Anchored Scheduling Implementation & Router Issue Report

**Date**: 2025-09-02  
**Implemented By**: Chronus Nexus  
**Reviewed By**: Mike (User)  
**For Review By**: Senior Dev  

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented anchored scheduling with frame indexing as specified. Testing revealed a critical architectural issue: workers have fixed router capability determined at startup, but active/standby roles swap at runtime, breaking subsequent patch operations.

## Part 1: Anchored Scheduling Implementation

### Changes Made to `supervisor_v3_router.py`

#### 1. Frame-Indexed Scheduling (Lines 117-126)
```python
# Anchored scheduling with frame indexing
buffer_period = BUFFER_SIZE / SAMPLE_RATE
t0 = time.perf_counter()  # Anchor time
n = 0  # Number of buffers produced

# Instrumentation counters (lightweight)
late_cycles = 0  # Times we needed catch-up
writes_dropped = 0  # Times ring was full
last_stats_time = t0
stats_interval = 500  # Report every N buffers
```

#### 2. Catch-Up Loop with Ring Protection (Lines 220-273)
```python
# Generate buffers if we're at or past the deadline for the next one
while now >= t0 + (n + 1) * buffer_period - 0.001:  # 1ms early is OK
    output_buffer = module_host.process_chain()
    
    if audio_ring.write(output_buffer):
        n += 1  # Successfully produced a buffer
        buffers_this_cycle += 1
        
        # Track if we're catching up
        if buffers_this_cycle > 1 and buffers_this_cycle == 2:
            late_cycles += 1
    else:
        # Ring is full, don't overfill
        writes_dropped += 1
        break
    
    # Update time for next iteration check
    now = time.perf_counter()
```

#### 3. Worker Instrumentation (Lines 255-259)
```python
# Print instrumentation stats periodically
if os.environ.get('CHRONUS_VERBOSE') and n > 0 and n % stats_interval == 0:
    period_us = int((now - last_stats_time) / stats_interval * 1e6)
    print(f"[WORKER {slot_id}] prod={n}, late={late_cycles}, drop={writes_dropped}, period_us≈{period_us}")
    last_stats_time = now
```

#### 4. Enhanced Supervisor Stats (Line 655)
```python
print(f"[STATS] None reads: {none_read_pct:.2f}%, Failovers: {self.failover_count}, Buffers out: {self.total_reads}")
```

### Implementation Quality

✅ **Correctly Implemented:**
- Frame-indexed scheduling eliminates cumulative drift
- Catch-up mechanism allows recovery from brief delays
- Ring protection prevents overfilling
- Lightweight instrumentation (no hot path allocations)
- Smart sleep with perf_counter for precision
- Preserved all existing functionality

✅ **Matches Senior Dev Specification:**
- Anchored scheduling with t0 + n*period calculation
- While loop for catch-up when behind
- Ring write protection with break on full
- Instrumentation counters as specified
- Stats output format as requested

## Part 2: Critical Router Architecture Issue

### The Problem

During testing, discovered that running multiple patch operations causes the worker to lose its modules. Root cause analysis revealed:

#### Current Architecture (Lines 75-76)
```python
is_standby = (slot_id == 1)  # Slot 1 starts as standby
module_host = ModuleHost(SAMPLE_RATE, BUFFER_SIZE, use_router=(use_router and is_standby))
```

#### The Issue Sequence

1. **Initial State**:
   - Slot 0: `is_standby=False`, no router capability, active
   - Slot 1: `is_standby=True`, router enabled, standby

2. **First `/patch/commit`**:
   - Builds patch in Slot 1 (has router)
   - Swaps: `active_idx.value = 1`
   - Slot 1 becomes active (works fine)
   - Slot 0 becomes standby (BUT has no router!)

3. **Second `/patch/create`**:
   - Attempts to build in "standby" Slot 0
   - Slot 0 can't process patch commands (no router)
   - Results in spam: `[WORKER 1] Router=True, modules: []`

### Why This Is Architecturally Significant

1. **Static vs Dynamic Roles**: Workers have static capabilities but dynamic roles
2. **One-Way Design**: Only Slot 1 can ever build patches
3. **Breaks Continuous Operation**: Can't build new patches after first commit
4. **Violates Fault Tolerance**: If Slot 1 fails, no patch building possible

### Potential Solutions

#### Option A: Both Workers Get Routers
```python
# Simple but has performance implications
module_host = ModuleHost(SAMPLE_RATE, BUFFER_SIZE, use_router=use_router)
```
- Pro: Any slot can be standby
- Con: Router overhead in active path

#### Option B: Dynamic Router Enable/Disable
```python
# Workers check active_idx to determine role
is_standby = (slot_id != active_idx.value)
# Would need ModuleHost.enable_router() / disable_router()
```
- Pro: Maintains performance separation
- Con: Complex state management, needs ModuleHost changes

#### Option C: Dedicated Standby Slot
```python
# Always rebuild in Slot 1, swap, then clear Slot 0
# Never let Slot 0 be standby
```
- Pro: Minimal changes needed
- Con: Asymmetric design, limits flexibility

## Part 3: Test Results Summary

### Sample Rate Verification
- **Device**: 44100Hz (matches code - no resampling issues)
- **Confirmation**: `Default device sample rate: 44100.0Hz`

### Audio Quality (Partial Testing)
- Initial test showed worker functioning with modules
- Could not complete sustained testing due to router issue
- Worker stats visible: `[WORKER 1] Router=True, modules: ["osc1"]`

### Unable to Complete Due to Router Issue
- Second test attempt failed immediately
- Worker showed empty modules repeatedly
- Prevented gathering of timing statistics

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Workaround)
1. Document that only ONE patch commit works per session
2. Restart supervisor for each new patch
3. Test anchored scheduling with single-patch limitation

### Short-Term Fix
Implement Option C (Dedicated Standby):
- Minimal code changes
- Preserves current performance model
- Add check to prevent Slot 0 from being standby

### Long-Term Solution
Implement Option B (Dynamic Router):
- Requires ModuleHost API changes
- Maintains performance optimization
- Fully symmetric design

## Conclusion

The anchored scheduling implementation is correct and follows specifications exactly. However, testing revealed a fundamental architectural issue where workers cannot properly swap active/standby roles due to static router initialization.

This is not a simple bug but an architectural assumption that needs revisiting. The system works for a single patch commit but fails on subsequent operations.

**Next Steps**:
1. Decide on architectural solution (A, B, or C)
2. Test anchored scheduling with single-patch workaround
3. Implement chosen solution for router issue
