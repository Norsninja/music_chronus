# CP3 Implementation Status Report - Critical Issues Found

**Date**: 2025-09-02  
**Implemented By**: Chronus Nexus  
**Tested By**: Mike  
**For Review By**: Senior Dev  
**Status**: PARTIALLY WORKING - Critical performance issues

## Executive Summary

Router fix allows multiple commits but anchored scheduling causes catastrophic performance degradation. Workers enter death spiral trying to catch up, producing millions of dropped buffers while audio starves.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Router Fix (WORKING)
✅ Generic `spawn_worker()` method with `is_standby` parameter  
✅ Router capability follows standby role, not slot number  
✅ Multiple patch commits succeed (3 tested)  
✅ Slot switching works (0→1→0)  

### 2. Anchored Scheduling (BROKEN)
❌ Workers produce buffers frantically (period_us≈0)  
❌ Ring buffer constantly full (1.7M+ drops)  
❌ Audio underruns despite buffer production  
❌ System becomes unresponsive  

## Critical Log Analysis

### Death Spiral Pattern
```
[WORKER 1] prod=500, late=125, drop=1727148, period_us≈0
```
- `late=125`: Worker is constantly behind
- `drop=1727148`: 1.7 MILLION buffers dropped (ring full)
- `period_us≈0`: Producing buffers as fast as possible
- Result: CPU spinning, no useful audio output

### Audio Starvation
```
ALSA lib pcm.c:8740:(snd_pcm_recover) underrun occurred
[AUDIO] Status: output underflow
```
Despite frantic buffer production, audio device gets no data.

### Module Loss After Swap
```
[CALLBACK] Switched to slot 1
[WORKER 1] Router=True, modules: []
```
Worker 1 becomes active but shows empty modules (separate issue).

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Anchored Scheduling Problem

The catch-up loop is too aggressive:
```python
while now >= t0 + (n + 1) * buffer_period - 0.001:
    # This keeps producing until caught up
    # But ring is full, so drops everything
```

When a worker falls behind (respawn, heavy load), it tries to produce ALL missed buffers immediately. With ring size of 8-16 buffers, this floods the system.

### Why Period Shows ~0 Microseconds
```python
period_us = int((now - last_stats_time) / stats_interval * 1e6)
```
When producing 500 buffers instantly in the catch-up loop, the time per buffer approaches zero.

## Comparison with V2

V2 uses simpler deadline scheduling without aggressive catch-up:
```python
if current_time >= next_buffer_time - 0.001:
    # Produce ONE buffer
    # Update next_buffer_time
    # Don't try to catch up all at once
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fix (Revert to Simple Deadline)
Remove the while loop, produce at most 1-2 buffers per iteration:
```python
# Instead of: while now >= deadline
# Use: if now >= deadline (produce one)
# Optional: Allow ONE catch-up buffer if very late
if now >= t0 + (n + 2) * buffer_period:
    # Produce 2 buffers max
```

### Ring Buffer Monitoring
Add check before catch-up:
```python
if ring.available_slots() < 2:
    # Don't produce more
    break
```

### Reset After Respawn
When worker respawns, reset t0 to current time:
```python
# After respawn
t0 = time.perf_counter()
n = 0  # Start fresh, don't try to catch up missed time
```

## Working Elements

Despite performance issues:
- Router fix works correctly
- Multiple commits succeed
- OSC commands process correctly
- Module creation works

## Test Command Sequence
```bash
# This sequence worked but caused performance issues:
/patch/create osc1 simple_sine
/patch/commit
# Slot switches 0→1 ✓

/patch/create osc2 simple_sine  
/patch/commit
# Slot switches 1→0 ✓

/patch/create osc3 simple_sine
/patch/commit
# Slot switches 0→1 ✓
```

## Conclusion

The router fix is correct and enables multi-commit sessions. However, the anchored scheduling implementation is too aggressive and needs limiting:

1. **Limit catch-up** to 1-2 buffers max
2. **Check ring space** before producing
3. **Reset anchor** after respawn
4. **Consider reverting** to V2's simpler approach

The "buffering" artifacts reported earlier are likely caused by this same issue - workers producing bursts of buffers instead of steady flow.
