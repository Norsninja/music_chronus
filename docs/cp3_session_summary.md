# CP3 Session Summary - Partial Success

**Date**: 2025-09-02  
**Session Duration**: ~3 hours  
**Final Status**: Router fixed, scheduling improved, audio issues remain

## Achievements

### ✅ Router Fix Complete
- Implemented `spawn_worker()` with `is_standby` parameter
- Router capability now follows role, not slot number
- Multiple patch commits work (tested 3 cycles successfully)
- Fixed `use_router` parameter usage in worker

### ✅ Well-Behaved Producer Implemented
- Rate-limited to 2 buffers per cycle
- Ring occupancy check prevents flooding
- Soft re-anchor for drift recovery
- Stats show `occ=2, drop=0` consistently

### ✅ Performance Issues Resolved
- No more death spiral (was: 1.7M drops)
- No more CPU spinning (was: period_us≈0)
- Ring buffer maintains target occupancy

## Remaining Issues

### ❌ Audio Quality
- Artifacts still present ("bum, dun nah nuh")
- Brief audio bursts then silence
- 44.40% none reads despite buffer production

### ❌ Silent Buffer Problem
Workers produce many `RMS=0.000000` buffers, especially after swaps. Pattern observed:
1. Swap occurs
2. Brief audio (few buffers)
3. Then silent buffers

### Possible Root Causes
1. **Module state loss**: Gates might reset to off during swap
2. **Router in active worker**: Active worker with router might not process correctly
3. **Parameter synchronization**: Values not reaching DSP modules

## Code Changes Summary

### supervisor_v3_router.py
1. **Lines 344-385**: Generic `spawn_worker()` method
2. **Lines 116-135**: Well-behaved producer initialization
3. **Lines 229-277**: Rate-limited production loop
4. **Lines 280-286**: Fixed stats printing (no spam)
5. **Lines 610-615**: Respawn with correct `is_standby`

## Test Results

### Metrics (Good)
- `occ=2`: Target occupancy maintained ✓
- `drop=0`: No buffer flooding ✓  
- `late=593`: Some catch-up but manageable
- `period_us≈9240`: Reasonable timing

### Audio (Bad)
- Multiple commits work but audio cuts out
- Artifacts throughout playback
- High none-reads percentage

## Session Learnings

1. **Aggressive scheduling catastrophic**: Unbounded catch-up floods system
2. **Static role assignment breaks swapping**: Workers need dynamic roles
3. **Small fixes cascade**: Stats printing bug from modulo check
4. **Following directions crucial**: Stop means stop immediately

## Recommendations for Next Session

### Investigate Silent Buffers
- Check if gates are being reset
- Verify module parameters persist
- Test without router in active worker

### Consider Simpler Architecture
- Maybe both workers should have router disabled
- Or only build patches without swapping
- Test v2 supervisor for comparison

### Parameter Smoothing
If audio works but has stepping artifacts, implement:
- Per-buffer linear ramps
- Preallocated ramp arrays
- Focus on cutoff/gain parameters

## Conclusion

Significant progress made - router fix enables multi-commit sessions and well-behaved producer prevents system overload. However, audio quality issues persist, likely due to module state management during swaps rather than scheduling.

The 44% none-reads with silent buffers suggests the DSP chain breaks after swapping, not a timing issue. Next session should focus on why modules produce silence after worker respawn.
