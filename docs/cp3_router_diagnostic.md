# CP3 Router Integration Diagnostic Report

**Date**: 2025-01-02  
**Issue**: Patch commits but no audio output  
**Severity**: High - Core functionality broken

## Observed Behavior

### What's Working
- OSC messages received correctly
- Modules created in supervisor (3 modules tracked)
- Worker processes communicating via patch_queue
- Slot swap occurs successfully (failover count: 1)
- No audio dropouts (0.00% none reads)

### What's Failing

#### Issue 1: PatchRouter Missing Method
```
[WORKER] Patch commit failed: 'PatchRouter' object has no attribute 'build_execution_order'
```
**Location**: worker_process line ~147  
**Impact**: Patch cannot be validated/finalized  

#### Issue 2: Router Module Registration Disconnect
```
[Router] Cannot connect - module not found
[WORKER] Connected osc1 -> env1
```
**Observation**: Router reports "module not found" but worker still processes connection  
**Theory**: Modules added to ModuleHost but not to PatchRouter's internal registry

## Root Cause Analysis

### Problem 1: Method Name Mismatch
The worker calls `router.build_execution_order()` but PatchRouter likely has a different method name.

**Investigation needed**:
```python
# Check actual PatchRouter methods
grep "def.*order" patch_router.py
```

### Problem 2: Module Registration Flow
Modules are created in ModuleHost but router doesn't know about them.

**Current flow**:
1. OSC → Supervisor → patch_queue → Worker
2. Worker creates module via registry
3. Worker adds to ModuleHost via `module_host.add_module()`
4. Router.connect() called but router has no module records

**Missing step**: Router needs to be informed when modules are added

## Quick Fixes to Test

### Fix 1: Correct Method Name
Check PatchRouter for the actual method name (might be `update_execution_order()` or `rebuild()`)

### Fix 2: Register Modules with Router
When creating a module, also inform the router:
```python
if cmd_type == 'create':
    # ... create module ...
    module_host.add_module(module_id, module)
    if router:
        router.add_node(module_id)  # Add to router's graph
```

## Questions for Investigation

1. Does PatchRouter track modules separately from ModuleHost?
2. What's the actual method name for building execution order?
3. Should router be managing the modules or just connections?
4. Why does worker continue after router error?

## Test Command Sequence

The exact commands that triggered the issue:
```python
/patch/create osc1 simple_sine
/patch/create env1 adsr  
/patch/create filter1 biquad_filter
/patch/connect osc1 env1
/patch/connect env1 filter1
/patch/commit
```

## Next Steps

1. Check PatchRouter implementation for actual method names
2. Verify module registration flow between ModuleHost and PatchRouter
3. Add router.add_node() calls when creating modules
4. Test with debug output in worker process
