# Project Vision - Music Chronus

*Captured from interview with project creator - 2025-08-31*

## The Problem We're Solving

The problem is a creative one - I want to collaborate with AI to make music. I want to say, "Yo! Chronus, drop in some kick and snare for a DnB song," you run commands in the CLI, and kicks and snares are populated at 175 BPM. "Nice work Chronus, now drop a dirty bass at the top." "Awesome, let's clip and limit the high end." "Now let's add a 303-style synth, and let's make a call and response," etc.

What I found is TidalCycles was incredibly hard to get working through WSL to Windows. There may be other options, but we want a CLI-style modular synthesizer sandbox, where through a headless mode I can explain what I want with you in the chat session here, and you connect to a tmux pane and make it happen.

## The "Aha!" Moment

I want to continually collaborate with AI on different things I have always wanted to do - coding, art, scripts, now music. The aha moment was nothing off the shelf working for this type of collaboration.

## Why This Approach

It has to be this approach for AIs to be able to work with it currently. The trifecta of AI corporations are all building CLI agents, and I use them all - they all work roughly the same, can use all the shell tools but in headless mode. This means you can do anything if it is headless. I have learned what "headless" means because of CLI agents.

## Collaboration Vision

An ideal session is we create some weird and wacky sounds together. If it works, maybe we record our sessions and put them on YouTube - it would be the new DJs: AI vs DJ, or AiJs, or hopefully some new symbiotic session.

## Technical Philosophy

This project exists because existing music tools weren't built for AI collaboration. They assume a human is operating a GUI or learning complex syntax. We need something that's:

- **Headless by design** - Works without displays or interactive modes
- **Command-driven** - Natural for AI agents to operate
- **Modular** - Can grow and adapt to new ideas
- **Real-time** - No waiting for compilation or rendering
- **Collaborative** - Built for human-AI partnership, not just human operation

## What Makes This Different

This isn't trying to replace Ableton or Logic. It's not competing with TidalCycles or SuperCollider. It's creating a new category: **collaborative musical instruments** designed from the ground up for human-AI partnership in real-time music creation.

## Musical Background & Style

My music preferences are raw, authentic, aggressive sounding music - even my classical has to be, for lack of a better word, "driving." My DJing evolved from house music to techno to DnB. DnB is the most fun, or some hard, dark, organic sounding house/techno. There's a DJ DRC and she would always have these amazing organic analog growing sounds - it was very cool. I like that in all my music.

I listen to Christopher Lawrence still - that was one of the first DJs I really liked in the underground scene, and Tony Gamboa. Christopher Lawrence still makes live DJ sets which are my favorite. I used to record live DJ sets and had some views.

## Technical Boundaries

I don't want to make some new DAW that's trying to copy Ableton or Studio One, but I need to give you access to CLI tools, and we need a sandbox that will sequence and allow our modules to work together. It doesn't need a visual interface with cool EQs etc. Just like we code together, we can send commands to our studio to make music.

## Evolution Path

I haven't had a chance to think about how this will grow - I just want to get it working in place of TidalCycles so we can start making any kind of music. But I see this evolving by using realtime models that are multimodal that can "hear" to give feedback.

## Success Vision

Success looks like: firing up a tmux session, having a conversation about the music we want to make, and then making it happen through a combination of natural language direction and real-time synthesis. The instrument grows with each session, adding new capabilities as we discover new musical ideas together.

This is about pioneering a new form of musical expression - one that couldn't exist without AI collaboration.
