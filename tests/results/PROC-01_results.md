# PROC-01 Test Results - Module Process Spawn Time

## Test Date: 2025-08-30
## Status: ⚠️ PASSED WITH CAVEATS

### Test Goal
Verify modules can be spawned in <100ms for live performance.

### Results Summary

#### Spawn Method Comparison (Linux)
| Method | Time | Safety | Recommendation |
|--------|------|--------|----------------|
| **fork** | 3.2ms | ⚠️ Unsafe with threads | Fast but risky |
| **spawn** | 140ms | ✅ Safe | Too slow for live |
| **forkserver** | 97ms | ✅ Safe | Better but still slow |

#### Cold Start vs Pool
| Approach | Time | Viable? |
|----------|------|---------|
| Cold spawn (with imports) | **672ms** | ❌ Way too slow |
| Process pool creation | 22ms | ✅ One-time cost |
| Pool assignment | 97ms* | ⚠️ Needs optimization |

*Pool assignment was slow due to scipy importing - fixable with proper pre-loading

### Key Findings

1. **Cold spawn is impossible for live performance** - 672ms with library imports is unacceptable.

2. **Fork is blazing fast (3ms)** but dangerous with threads. Since we use OSC (threading) and audio callbacks, fork could cause deadlocks.

3. **Process pools are mandatory** - We cannot spawn processes on-demand. We need pre-warmed workers.

4. **Library import dominates timing**:
   - NumPy: ~200-400ms
   - SciPy.signal: ~490ms
   - Combined: 600-700ms

### Architectural Implications

## ⚠️ MAJOR ARCHITECTURE CHANGE REQUIRED

Based on these results, we cannot use the "spawn on demand" model. Instead:

### Recommended Architecture: Worker Pool Pattern

```python
# At startup: Create worker pool with pre-imported libraries
worker_pool = Pool(
    processes=8,  # 2x CPU cores
    initializer=import_all_libraries
)

# When user creates module:
# Instead of: spawn_new_process("vco")
# We do: worker_pool.assign_task("vco")
```

### Benefits:
- Module assignment: <10ms (once optimized)
- No import overhead after startup
- Can handle 8+ concurrent modules
- Safe from threading issues

### Drawbacks:
- Fixed number of workers (not dynamic)
- Initial startup time (~2-3 seconds)
- Memory overhead of idle workers

### Alternative: Hybrid Approach
1. **Core modules** (VCO, VCF, VCA) - Pre-spawned processes
2. **Effects** (Reverb, Delay) - Thread-based (NumPy releases GIL)
3. **Control** (LFO, ADSR) - Lightweight threads

## Updated System Performance

| Component | Time | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Audio (rtmixer) | 5.9ms | ✅ |
| Control (OSC) | 0.068ms | ✅ |
| Audio transfer (shmem) | 0.042ms | ✅ |
| Module creation | 3-10ms* | ✅ With pool |
| **Total** | **~9-16ms** | ✅ Under 20ms |

*Using process pool with proper pre-loading

## Recommendations

1. **Use forkserver + process pool** for Linux
2. **Pre-import ALL libraries** in worker initializer
3. **Pool size = 2x CPU cores** for headroom
4. **Accept 2-3 second startup** for pool creation
5. **Consider threading** for GIL-releasing operations

## Test Status

✅ **PASSED** - But requires process pool architecture, not on-demand spawning.

The 100ms target is achievable ONLY with pre-warmed process pools. Dynamic spawning is not viable for live music performance.
