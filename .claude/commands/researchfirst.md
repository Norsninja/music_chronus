description: Preliminary research for new proposed implementation
---
Before implementing , first confirm the scope of implentation. Research existing patterns in our codebase
(engine, modules, OSC routes, schema, pattern save/load) and check industry standards/pyo-native approaches
for how others achieve this. Propose the best-fit solution that integrates cleanly with our pipeline and schema
registry. You should dispatch the Research Scout in parallel on multiple subtopics; they are already instructed to return a 
comprehensive research doc (they will output this doc to project/research). 
Share the created docs, and discuss the findings with Mike before making any changes.
