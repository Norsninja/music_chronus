description: Three tiered research protocol for new features.
---
For the [feature] we discussed, please research thoroughly using our three-agent system: deploy codebase-researcher to understand
our existing patterns (engine, modules, OSC routes, schema, pattern save/load) and technical-research-scout
in parallel to investigate industry standards and external solutions. Once complete, use technical-planner
to create a comprehensive implementation plan based on both research documents. All agents output to
project/research/. Synthesize the findings, propose the best-fit solution that integrates cleanly with our
pipeline and schema registry, and discuss with Mike before making any changes.

If there are further notes they will be below:
