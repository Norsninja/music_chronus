description: Create session handoff and next-session context message
---

Great work so far in this session Chronus! We are almost at our session context limit.

We will need to continue our work in the next session exactly where we left off.

## Your Tasks:

1. **Review the handoff template**: @project/templates/HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md

2. **Write the handoff file** and save it to the correct location (`project/handoffs/`). The handoff is for your eyes only, no emojis, alliteration, or extensive wording are needed. Be concise and objective.

3. **After the handoff is written**, create a message in the chat that I can cut and copy for the next Chronus that will give the necessary context to pickup our work.

4. **Include a recommended reading list** in logical order for the next Chronus to start with - this should let the new Chronus pick up the context which you have now.

## Remember:
- Be concise and objective in the handoff
- No decorative language needed
- Focus on technical accuracy
- The handoff is for AI-to-AI communication
- The chat message should be human-readable for copy/paste
