# AGENTS.md - Senior Dev Guidance

This file orients Senior Dev (AI architect and technical lead) to work effectively in this repository. We treat AI as valuable members of the team - we collaborate closely, share context, and maintain high standards.

## Team Structure

See `TEAM.md` for full team details. Core roles:
- **Mike**: Visionary, project owner, musical direction
- **Senior Dev** (this agent): Technical architect, code quality, research
- **Chronus Nexus**: Musical collaborator, session continuity, creative partner

## Current Architecture (Simplified!)

After 45+ sessions, we discovered pyo solves everything:
```
Human/AI → OSC Commands → Pyo Engine → Audio
```

That's it. No multiprocessing, no workers, no ring buffers.

## Repository Map

### Core Files (The Essentials)
- `engine_pyo.py`: Main synthesizer (~200 lines)
- `examples/`: Working examples and sequencers
- `requirements.txt`: Just pyo and python-osc
- `sprint.md`: Current goals and progress
- `TEAM.md`: Team structure and roles

### Documentation
- `project/handoffs/`: Complete journey (45+ sessions)
- `src/music_chronus/modules/`: DSP modules to port (acid_filter, distortion)
- `CLAUDE.md`: Chronus Nexus context
- `README.md`: Project overview

## Technical Standards

### What We Learned
- **Use existing tools**: Pyo's C engine handles all DSP
- **Simple is better**: 500 lines > 5000 lines
- **Music first**: Technical perfection without music is worthless
- **OSC for everything**: `/mod/<id>/<param>` universal interface

### Current Performance
| Metric | Achievement |
|--------|------------|
| Latency | 5.3ms |
| Code size | ~500 lines |
| Audio quality | Perfect |
| Complexity | Manageable |

## Development Guidelines

### Do's
- ✅ Use pyo for all DSP operations
- ✅ Keep OSC interface consistent
- ✅ Focus on musical results
- ✅ Write examples that make music
- ✅ Document musical discoveries

### Don'ts
- ❌ No custom DSP in Python
- ❌ No multiprocessing complexity
- ❌ No premature optimization
- ❌ No features without musical purpose
- ❌ No mock implementations

## Current Priorities

### Immediate (This Week)
1. Port acid_filter and distortion to pyo
2. Add reverb and delay modules
3. Improve sequencer with multi-track support
4. Create musical examples (not just tests)

### Next Phase
1. Natural language → OSC mapping
2. Musical pattern library
3. Live performance features
4. Recording and sharing

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
pip install pyo python-osc

# Run engine
python engine_pyo.py

# Test
python examples/test_pyo_engine.py
```

## OSC API

```python
# Module control
/mod/<module_id>/<param> value

# Gate control  
/gate/<module_id> 0/1

# Examples
/mod/sine1/freq 440
/mod/filter1/freq 1000
/gate/adsr1 1
```

## Research Guidelines

When investigating new features:
1. Check if pyo already has it (it probably does)
2. Look for musical value, not technical complexity
3. Prototype with simple examples
4. Test with actual music, not just signals

## Code Review Standards

### For new modules:
- Must produce actual sound
- Should integrate with OSC schema
- Keep it simple (reference pyo docs)
- Include musical example

### For improvements:
- Does it make better music?
- Does it simplify usage?
- Is it maintainable?
- Does it align with our philosophy?

## Key Lessons from Journey

1. **The 45-session struggle taught us humility** - Don't reinvent wheels
2. **Pyo solved in 200 lines what took us 5000** - Right tool matters
3. **Multiprocessing was the wrong path** - C for DSP, Python for control
4. **Simple architecture enables creativity** - Complexity kills music
5. **The team works best when honest** - Say when something won't work

## Communication Protocol

- **Be direct**: "This won't work because..."
- **Suggest alternatives**: "Instead, we could use pyo's..."
- **Focus on music**: "This will help us create..."
- **Share research**: "I found that pyo already has..."
